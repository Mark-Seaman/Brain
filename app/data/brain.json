-*-muse-*-\n\nYour success at automating major aspects of your life depends on how\nwell you apply the following core principles. It is possible to spend\na lot of effort and see very little return.\n\n * Incremental development\n * Long-term return on investment\n * Test everything\n * Embedded knowledge\n * Follow the pain\n * Focus on one thing\n * Minimum planning\n\n**Incremental development**\n\nTake small steps.  No, take smaller steps.  Ok, take baby steps.  But\ntake a lot of them.  Don't ever embark on a glorious project to\noverhaul everything. Make a small adjustment, keeping everything else\nthe same.  Observe the result and do it again.  Small changes always\nwin over big ones.\n\n**Long-term return on investment**\n\nYour plans should always be built to maximize your value over the long\nterm.  Because you are going to build in small steps you are protected\nin the short term.  But you will have to make a small investment in\nthe short term.  Pick things to automate that have a great payoff for\nthe rest of your life.\n\n**Test everything**\n\nWhen you make changes don't trust them right off.  Make sure that the\nautomatic thing is doing exactly what you want.  After you see it work\nseveral times then you can fully trust it.  Things don't typically\nbreak themselves.  However, if you change something related then you\nhave to test that whole area around it.\n\n**Capture embedded knowledge**\n\nIf you have to spend time figuring something out then why not write a\nscript to record what you learned.  If it is a computer task then\nconsider writing an executable script to do anything that you spend\ntime learning.  Even if the script needs to be adjusted before it will\nwork later, then it is still a good basis of future learning.\n\n**Follow the pain**\n\nIf it hurts you fix it!  Automation is tremendously empowering.  If\nyou spend to much time finding emails, then fix it.  If you find\nyourself editing the same type of text files, over and over, then fix\nit. If you spend time worrying about replicating files between\ncomputers, then fix it.\n\n**Focus on one thing**\n\nChange one thing at a time.  If you change multiple things then you\nmay not know what caused the change.  Also bigger changes may make\nyour overall work output decrease.  Our goal is to keep the work\nflowing and always be changing something to make it better.  Don't\nrisk shutting the system down.\n\n**Minimum planning**\n\nIt is better to make small plans than large ones.  Big changes imply\nbig plans and big risk.  Focus on implementing small changes rather\nthan entertaining grandiose ideas of a new world order.  You will get\nthere faster with stable incremental change.\n", "user": 3, "title": "Seven Principles of Automation"}}, {"pk": 6, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/MyBook/Public/Automate/Transparency", "time": "2014-06-15T20:35:55.401", "text": "* Automation Becomes Transparent *                 -*-muse-*-\n\nA task is automatic when you can't see it anymore. Think about\nlearning to drive.  There was a time when you had to consciously think\nabout pushing the brake or the gas. This produced a lot of stess,\nbecause the consequences of doing the wrong thing were enormous.\n\nMany people use their computers in a very conscious way.  They think\nabout each and every step to do.  After spending thousands of hours on\na computer it is still possible to be consciously thinking about how\nto repeat the steps that lead to a result, rather than the goal\nitself.\n\nDo you every get a bad feeling of deja vu, all over again?  Do you\never feel in a position to push the red button every 118 seconds\nfor no apparent reason?  Refuse to do this any longer.  Make your\ncomputer do it for you.\n\nThis sense of repeditive, redundancy is an indicator that something\nneeds to change.  Now it is time to think creatively.  If your job\nforces you to write TPS reports every Tuesday, then make a script that\ngathers the data and writes the report.  Every Tuesday it wakes up and\nreads your unique data and puts it into the form that everyone else\nlikes and sends it to the correct people.\n\nThis system will make you the hero of your workgroup.  Share it with\nothers. Your group will be the only one with 100% compliance on TPS\nreports.  Instead of writing an invoice manually, automate it from the\nunique data that you have.  Refuse to do repetetive tasks any longer.\n\nRedundancy is in the eye of the beholder.  If you feel like something\nis redundant then it is.  If it feels painful then it is.  The\nquestion is what you will do with that pain.  \n\nImagine a genie that could grant three wishes.  Anything can be\nautomated.  What will it be?  How will you spend your silver bullet?\nWhat three changes would make your life substantially better?  How can\nyou use automation to fix your core concerns?\n\nThese questions are worth wrestling with.  The answers will put you on\na new path.\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Automation Becomes Transparent"}}, {"pk": 7, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/MyBook/Public/Automate/EasySetup", "time": "2014-06-15T20:35:55.593", "text": "* Automate Your World *                 -*-muse-*-\n\nHow to make computers simplify your life.\n by Mark Seaman\n\n\n**2. Easy Computer Setup**\n\nImagine what it would be like if you could set up a new computer for\n$400 and invest two hours to get it fully configured. It is entirely\npossible.  We will walk through the steps to show you how.\n\nIf it is easy to set up one computer, then it is possible to setup\nmany computers.  I have five different computers that I use daily.\nEach computer has different physical characteristics that make it\nuseful for certain tasks.\n\nI use the following:\n\n  *  Desktop - when in my home office\n  *  Laptop - when I work at client sites\n  *  Netbook - when I sit on the couch to write\n  *  iPad - for reading books\n  *  Smart Phone - for looking up things on the internet\n\nIt is much more effective to use multiple computers for specialized\ntasks then it is to use one computer for everything.  I don't want to\ncarry my netbook with me into the grocery store when a smart phone\ncould work for that.  I also don't want to use my laptop in my office\nwhen I could use a large monitor instead.\n\nSetting a system with multiple computers requires three things: Low\ncost computer, Easy computer setup, and Ability to mangage files\nacross computers.\n\nLow cost computers are a reality.  A year ago I bought a computer for\nmy home server.  It costs $200 from Best Buy (Acer Inspire).  I\ninstalled open source software so that the total cost of the computer\nwas the cost of the hardware.  It is very practical to buy low cost\nhardware with enough capability to do specific jobs.\n\nI regularly troll for the standard prices of laptops and desktops.\nThe standard price of low-end laptops is $450 and desktops can be had\nfor $350.  Add standard open-source software for free, and you end up\nwith an entire computer system costing less than $500.\n\nYou could buy a computer system for $1000, but why not get two.  Spend\n$1100 and get a netbook too.  Different computer can be used for\ndifferent uses.  Each computer gete assigned to tasks that make the\nmost sense for its physical characteristics.\n\nThis bring us to the next issue.  For muliple computers to make sense\nthere needs to be an efficient way to fully configure and manage them.\n\nYour time is far more valuable than your money spent.  It does no good\nto buy a $300 computer only to spend $1000 worth of your time trying\nto get it properly set up.\n\nThis guide will show you ways to set up and manage computer systems\nthat are simple and quick.  The first time through the process you can\nexpect to spend several hours.  But after that, you will be able to\nquickly clone new computers each time you get one.\n\nThe next area of concern is how to share your files across many\ncomputers.  There are several very easy ways to make your files\naccessible from many computers.  There are several major issue that\nyou need to address that we will explore in detail.\n", "user": 3, "title": "Automate Your World"}}, {"pk": 8, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/MyBook/Public/Automate/AutomateWhat", "time": "2014-06-15T20:35:55.792", "text": "* What should you automate? *                 -*-muse-*-\n\nThe answer to this question is simple.  Automate everything that will\nsave you time over the long run.  This is very unique to the\nindividual.  Different people spend time on different activities.\n\nLet's walk through a simple process for determining this in your\nworld.  Sit down with a note pad and make a list of everything that\nyou did yesterday.  Write down every activity that you did for more\nthan a half hour at a time.  This list is your big things (at least\nfor yesterday).\n\nNow list the little things.  Each of your big things contains little\ntasks that you must do.  For example, you may have a task that\ninvolves a meeting.  What is actually required to do that may look\nmore like:\n\n * figure out a good time to meet\n * schedule the conference room and phone numbers\n * send invitations to participants\n * prepare the agenda\n * think through the discussion\n * host the meeting\n * send out follow up notes\n * follow up on actions brought up during the meeting\n * create a status email to others \n\nThis is typical of most of the things that you do.  What looks like a\ntask is really a cluster of smaller tasks.   Leaving out one of these\nsmall tasks could compromise the entire goal of doing the thing in the\nfirst place.\n\nI recommend that you go through this formality once so that you can\nsee what is involved in your typical work day.  Make a list of at\nleast ten large tasks.  Then explode each of these tasks into at least\nfive subtasks that were required to get the job done.\n\nThe next step is to understand the total effort that is required by\nthe small tasks.  Gather together all of the small tasks that are\nsimilar.  Then try to find the biggest amount of total time spent by\nquantifying them.  You should have around fifty small tasks to work with.\n\nIf your typical day involves spending twenty minutes looking for your\ncar keys or someone's email address, then start there.  Look for tasks\nthat consume time but don't produce value.\n", "user": 3, "title": "What should you automate?"}}, {"pk": 9, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/MyBook/Public/Automate/Index", "time": "2014-06-15T20:35:55.960", "text": "* Automate Your World *                 -*-muse-*-\n\nHow to make computers simplify your life.\n by Mark Seaman\n______________________________________________________________\n\n**Table of Contents**\n\n[[Title]]\n\n[[AutomateYourWorld][Introduction]]\n\n1.

Create a Habit of Automating**\n\nAre you tired of having stacks of paper scattered around your office?\nDo you hate losing bills or forgetting appointments?  These thing\nshould never happen but they do.\n\nThis guide will show you how to prevent your precious time from being\nstolen. Stop trying to repair situations that could have been\nprevented.  Instead build system that take care of all your mental\nbaggage.  Unload your mind so that it can be used for more human\nthings.\n\nMany of us feel \"behind the eight-ball\".  We know that we need to get\norganized but are unsure where to start.  This guide will point you in\nspecific directions and give you step-by-step details of how to build\nyour own systems.\n\nThis is a book about how to use computers to organize your mental\nstuff. Many of these principles also apply to how to organize physical\nstuff as well.  My experience has been that adopting good practices\nfor organizing my information, also causes me to look at my physical\nworld through a different lens.\n\nIn the internet world there are plenty of great tools to implement\neverything you  need.  Most of these tools are free (or etremely\ninexpensive). Avoid tools that cost over $50.  There is no need.\n\nI'll show you where to look and how to select the worlds best tools\nfor getting you organized.  By the time you are done reading this book\nyou will be well on your way to setting up a system that works for\nyou.\n\nLike any change, you get out of it what you put in.  Maybe you are at\na point where you are just curious enough to read a book but don't\nwant to go any further.  That's OK.  You will get a few ideas that may\ninspire other changes down the road.\n\nOn the other hand, if you are ready to embrace the ideas presented\nhere you life may look very different a year from now.  Try this\nexcercise.  Make a list of every time that something has gotten\nconfused due to lost information.  Estimate the cost of not being able\nto remember or find something critical.\n\nIf your computer has ever crashed, or been infected, or you have lost\nfiles, then you can probably still feel the pain.  Building robust\nsystems seems unimportant until you really need them.  But it is too\nlate at that point.\n\nI believe that it is not too soon to learn new computer skills.  These\nwill protect you from disasters.  More importantly, your overall life\nwill be smooother.\n\nYou will master the following core competencies:\n\n  * Quickly setup and maintain a computer\n  * Take advantage of free software\n  * Share all files across all your computers\n  * Manage photos, music, and junk in a way that makes sense\n  * Eliminate confusion about where the most recent file is\n  * Manage your life with two pieces of paper\n  * Capture every idea that comes to you\n  * Manage your email with maximum effectiveness\n  * Publish your web site in five seconds\n  * Organize your own view of the internet\n", "user": 3, "title": "Automate Your World"}}, {"pk": 11, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/MyBook/Public/Automate/ChangeYourLife", "time": "2014-06-15T20:35:56.294", "text": "* Why automation will change your life *                 -*-muse-*-\n\nWhat if you could put everything on auto-pilot?  Think of the\npotential that you could have if everything you wished to do could be\nfully accomplished by just speaking a word.  Imagine a computer with a\nmagic console.  Type the word and the thing is done (exactly how you\nwish it to be done).\n\nIf you have the ability to program, that goal is not far off.\nYou can create a daily habit of automation that is similar to cleaning\nup after yourself.  Most of us don't treat cleaning up as a monster\nproject that we dread doing.  Instead after we are done using\nsomething we put it away where it belongs.\n\nAutomation is more of a mindset than a project.  If you do something\nrepeatedly you ask, \"Why?\".  In order to automate you begin to see\nredundancy as a major problem.  Any task that you repeat a hundred\ntimes is a loss, while a task that you repeat 100,000 times is\nstealing your life.\n\nBased on my life expectancy, I have about 10,000 days left.  Any task\nthat I do ten times each day is likely to be done 100,000 times.  If\nthe task can be reduced by one minute it is a huge savings over my\nlifetime.  If you can find repetitive tasks that account for four\nhours of your day then you can double your work productivity.  \n\nHow you spend this new time is up to you.  You can accomplish twice as\nmuch for your boss.  This also means that you can spend half your time\ndoing relaxing activities or learning new skills.\n\nLearning to automate will change your life in a fundamental way.  It\nis not just about doing more.  Instead it shifts the focus away from\nbusy work to things that you really want to do.\n\nThe justification that you give to others is that you can accomplish\nmore with less effort.  But the true reason you automate is that it\nallows you to focus on what matters most.\n\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Why automation will change your life"}}, {"pk": 12, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/MyBook/Public/Automate/WebPublish", "time": "2014-06-15T20:35:56.496", "text": "* Automate Your World *                 -*-muse-*-\n\nHow to make computers simplify your life.\n by Mark Seaman\n\n\n**5. Mindless Web Publishing**\n\nEveryone should have a web site.  A simple web site that lets you\nshare your thoughts and ideas with others is easy to set up.  Once you\nget the general stucture in place it is very easy to maintain.\n\nThere are many comercial providers out there with either free or\ninexpensive hosting capabilities.  Expect to pay no more than $10 per\nmonth to have your own web site.\n\nA web site can be your window to the world.  Write your novel, keep a\njournal, share recipees, share photos.  These are all great things to\ndo.  People find that once they set up a site they get inspired to do\ncreative things with it.\n\nThere are several ways that you can create a web site.  You can build\nyour own site from scratch.  This takes a lot of effort to learn\nenough to be effective.  \n\nAnother alternative is for you to use the installable applications\navailable from your hosting provider.  For example, one of the hosting\nproviders that I use is Host Gator.  They have a control panel that\nlets users install over 50 application programs.\n\nIf I want to set up a blog, I would install Word Press and have a blog\nfully operational in about five minutes.  This is a professional\nprogram that deals with all of the features that are needed for a\nworld-class blog.\n\nThe third alternative is to get a professional web developer to build\na custom web site for you.  Unless your application is very unique\nthen you will spend a lot of money for very little value.\n\nAnother option is to use a service that is already running on the\nweb.  These are available to provide a wide range of services.  Just\nsign up for an account and begin using the service directly and\nimmediately. \n\nThis is by far the best alternative.  Someone else is responsible for\nkeeping the service running.  Your job is to post the desired\ncontent.

Ready, Set, Synchronize!**\n\nMost people these days are using multiple computers.  Whether it is\nhome and work, or different types of computers for different types of\ntasks.  This creates some new problems that must be solved.\n\nYou want to be able to access the same files from multiple computers.\nOnce you can access them, you want to modify them. The main problem is\nthat is difficult to know which is the most recent version of the same\nfile.\n\nThere are two main ways to solve this problem:\n    1. You access the same physical file from each computer\n    2. You modify the file and synchronize it with the other computers\n\nEach of these primary solutions has different advantages and\nlimitations.  Using the same exact file eliminates any questions about\nthe version of the file.  There is only one file.  \n\nBut this technique constrains you to having all of the computers\nconnected to the file server at all times.  This is not very practical\nin the internet/mobile device world that we have today.\n\nThe second alternative is to create a method for synchronizing all of\nthe files from whatever computer was used to modify them to all of the\nothers where they can be modified.  This solution also creates some\nnew challenges for us.\n\nThere are several free (or in-expensive) tools that perform this job\nnicely.  On Windows I recommend Sync Back by Two Bright Sparks.  For a\nweb tool use \"DropBox.com\".  On Linux use rsync.  All three of these\ntools let you copy the most recent copy from any computer to the rest.\n\nThe key problem that remains to be solved is how to handle deleted\nfiles.  Typically it is very useful to setup your sync tool so that it\ndoes not prompt you for what to do with files.  In general it is\nbetter to have tools that run periodically in the background.\n\nWhen a file is deleted it reappears automatically from another\ncomputer.  I have found that the best way to resolve this issue is to\nhave a script that lists specific files that have been deleted.  This\nscript keeps removing the deleted files each time it sees them.\nEventually the file is completely purged from all the computers.\n\nThe reason that I like this solution is that you can fully automate\nit. When you remove the file you add it to the 'prune' script. Every time\nafter that, the file is automatically removed.  Later on you may not\nremember which files you intended to delete and which ones you wish to\nretain.\n", "user": 3, "title": "Automate Your World"}}, {"pk": 14, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/MyBook/Public/Automate/AutomateYourWorld", "time": "2014-06-15T20:35:56.889", "text": "* Introduction *                                  -*-muse-*-\n\nHow to make computers simplify your life.\n by Mark Seaman\n\nThere is a huge gap between people that know how to get things done\nand those who constantly struggle to stay above the water.  Life\nis filled with noise and appointments, demands and distractions.  The\nmodern world is increasing the stress that we feel just to keep up.\n\nThis is a guide for how you can take back control.  Use computers to\ncontrol key aspects of your life that may have gotten away from you.\nAutomate critical repetitive tasks.  This will free up more time to do\nthe things you enjoy.\n\nHave you ever noticed how some people are able to always manage to keep\neverything organized?  They seem to have a system for everything.\nThey don't forget appointments, they can find information quickly, and\nthey never seem to be stressed by all of the demands.\n\nYou can get to that same state also.  With a little thought you can\ncreate systems that work for you.  Find your own balance of\norganization versus freedom. Create tools that work exactly like you\nthink rather than being forced to use someone else's idea of how\nthings should be.\n\nIn this book we will focus on the general principles of creating\neffective tools that are fully customized for you.  See what works and\nwhat doesn't and quickly get to a point where your tools are a natural\nextension of your personality.\n\nIt is time for a shift in mindset that will lead you to the next level\nof personal effectiveness.  Create an amazing life where you focus on\nthe interesting parts rather than the mundane.  Have systems that\nremember all of the important information, tasks, and contacts, so that\nyou don't have to.\n\nEach chapter will be look at an important area of this discussion.\n", "user": 3, "title": "Introduction"}}, {"pk": 15, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/MyBook/Public/Automate/CreateCommands", "time": "2014-06-15T20:35:57.032", "text": "* Automate Your World *                 -*-muse-*-\n\nHow to make computers simplify your life.\nby Mark Seaman\n\n\n**4. Create Commands for Everything You Do**\n\nCommands are extremely powerful because they allow you to express your\nspecific intent.  In the ideal world you would have a one word command\nthat you could type to do each of your recurring tasks.\n\nSure, you could go to your Start Menu and select your favorite web\nbrowser.  Then do to the \"Favorites\" and choose your bank's web site\nfrom a list.  But wouldn't it be easier to type 'bank'.\n\nThe problem is, the series of steps about how to do something is never\nfully encapsulated.  It is better to express the desired result then\nhave to remember all of the steps along the way.\n\nGraphical User Interfaces are wonderful for certain kinds of tasks.\nThey allow a first time user to click through the menus in order to\nsee what the program does.  A novice user with no training can\nexperiment and discover.\n\nThese same features can be a disadvantage for experienced users. All\nof the window structure can be very distracting.  You have scroll\nbars, tool bars, menus, menu bars, tabs, widgets, and window panes,\nall crying, \"Click ME!\"\n\nIt is easy to spend minutes clicking around in a program trying to remember\nwhat you started to do.  Graphical user interfaces are optimized for\nease of learning not for ease of use.\n\nThere are probably twenty to fifty things that you use a computer\nfor.  This means that you should have that many commands that take you\nright to the context that you need to get your result.\n\nOnce you get to the right context it is time to supply the essential\nhuman ingredient. This is decision making.  People are execellent at\nknowing what the desired results should be. Unfortunately, when humans\nuse computers they spend a lot of time trying to get to the right\ncontext to make the decisions.\n\nAny action that you do more than ten times a day should be automated.\nIf the result takes four actions then make it take one.  Spending five\nminutes automating frequent tasks will save you time.  But there is\nfar more at stake.\n\nAutomation protects your mind share.  Extra action that take several\nseconds can actually break your concentration.  If you are opening and\nclosing windows then you can easily become distracted by that thing\nover there.  You may never actually get to where you started to go.\n\nMental work requires concentration and computers are notorious for\ndistracting.  Consider adopting practices that protect your focus.\nThese will allow you to complete task quicker and with lower stress.\n", "user": 3, "title": "Automate Your World"}}, {"pk": 16, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/MyBook/Public/Automate/Title", "time": "2014-06-15T20:35:57.174", "text": "* Automate Your World *      -*-muse-*-\n How to make computers simplify your life. \n \n By Mark Seaman\n http://shrinking-world.org/Automate\n \n", "user": 3, "title": "Automate Your World"}}, {"pk": 17, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/MyBook/Public/50-Tricks/Index", "time": "2014-06-15T20:35:57.982", "text": "* 50 Tricks *                                       -*-muse-*-\n\nTeach an old dog web development\n\n[[node/Index][Node JS Tricks]]\n\n[[django/Index][Django Tricks]]\n\n[[python/Index][Python Tricks]]\n\n[[shell/Index][Shell Tricks]]\n\n[[test/Index][Test Tricks]]\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "50 Tricks"}}, {"pk": 18, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/MyBook/Public/50-Tricks/shell/Index", "time": "2014-06-15T20:35:58.385", "text": "* Shell Tricks *                                       -*-muse-*-\n\nUnderstanding a new technology involves learning new tricks\n\n[[show]]      List a command \n[[mkexe]]     Make a new command\n[[search]]    Search my source code\n[[src]]       List my source code\n[[project]]   Switch to a new project\n[[cptree]]    Copy a file tree\n", "user": 3, "title": "Shell Tricks"}}, {"pk": 19, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/MyBook/Public/50-Tricks/django/tutorial-app/Index", "time": "2014-06-15T20:35:58.565", "text": "* Tutorial App *                                       -*-muse-*-\n\nFollow this application as it is created step by step.\n\nThe tutorial builds a social networking app that can be used for interactive disucssions\nbetween users.\n\n[[../../../app/doc/Index][Sample Application]]\n\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Tutorial App"}}, {"pk": 20, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/MyBook/Public/50-Tricks/django/Index", "time": "2014-06-15T20:35:58.721", "text": "* Django Tricks *                                       -*-muse-*-\n\nTeaching an old dog Django\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\n**Automation**\n\n[[new-project]]         Create a new project\n\n[[app-hello]]           Simplest possible web app\n\n[[model-objects]]       Object Relational Mapping (objects & database)\n\n\n**View**\n\n[[view-template]]       Template Views (with no data)\n\n[[view-class]]          Class-based Generic Views (with data models)\n\n\n**Restful Web Services**\n\n[[rest]]                Django Rest Framework\n\n\n**Tutorial Application**\n\n[[tutorial-app]]        Show how to build a complete app in steps\n\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n**New Tricks to create**\n\nThe following content needs to be created.

You don't have\nto look very far to realize that the vast majority of projects to not\ndeliver what they promise.\n\nThis has been true since the beginning of the industry.  But with\nbetter tools, faster project cycles, and global outsourcing, the\nsituation has become critical.\n\nSoftware is still very expensive to develop, and customer expectations\nare high.  Your company may be betting its future on the next software\ndevelopment project to be done.  You can't aford for it to fail.\n\nMost projects fail to meet their goals because of uncontrolled scope.\nThe typical software project starts with a great idea for an\ninnovative way to meet a new customer need.  As the situation is\nanalyzed there are other needs discovered and added to the list of\ngoals.\n\nProjects that deliver value to customers quickly and effectively have\nvery simple and clear goals.   Projects that lose sight of the\nimportant goals inevitably grow in scope.  Every discussion leads to a\nnew goal or feature being added to the product.\n\nOver time, this burden of expectations becomes so great that the\nproject simply collapses under its own weight. This process is the\nnatural course of events.  It is entropy taking over a project.\n\nThe only way to prevent this untimely demise is to practice \"Ruthless\nPrioritization\".  A well run project has a clearly defined set of\ngoals.  These must be set in priority order and simple enough for\neveryone on the project to understand.\n\nAll of the work in the project should align with these goals and\neverything else should be pruned away.  By excersizing this high\ndegree of discipline the project can stay on track.  Everyone is\npulling in the same direction.\n\nThe project should be reviewed at least once a week to see if enough\nprogress is being made.  If the end goal is no longer feasible, based\non the current progress, then changes should be made to the project.\n\nThese small course corrections may keep your project healthy and\nguarantee that you deliver on the expectations.  You can either change\nthe expectations or the progress being made, but ulimately the two\nmust match.\n", "user": 3, "title": "Why Software Projects Fail"}}, {"pk": 26, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/MyBook/Public/Software/ProjectPlanning", "time": "2014-06-15T20:36:01.329", "text": "* World-class Project Planning *                 -*-muse-*-\n\n*Scope control is what guarantees success*\n---\n\n**Common problems with scope**\n\n * Identify the high risk areas\n * Wait until you know more to commit to features\n * Create the essential things first\n * Let feedback drive development\n\n\n**Honesty is the best policy**\n\n * Never agree to a death march\n * Constantly be negotiating expectations\n * Beware of unstated expectations\n * Short-cuts cost more\n\n\n**Force prioritization**\n\n * Everything is most important, same as no priority\n * Create and review your priorities rather than wait\n * Make small adjustments, not big ones\n * Shift discussion from predicting to demonstrating\n\n\n**Tracking dashboard**\n\n * Demonstrate progress every week\n * Get business value by completing features\n * When will it be done?

A\nlarge goal can be viewed as a series of smaller projects that can be\nbundled together for delivery. This is essential to effectively manage\nthe progress throughout the development.\n\nA large goal must be broken into a set of goals that make sense.  Give\nsome thought to your problem.  Figure out where the natural break\npoints are in the system.  Then identify the primary goal of each of\nthe building blocks.\n\nThe very act of doing this step will lead you to a system architecture\nthat is much more maintainable than it would be without it.  Each part\nof your system can be developed and tested independently of the\nothers.\n\nSubdividing a system that will require 5 engineering years to build it\nin two separate pieces will yield parts that should take less than 2\nengineering years each.  This is because of the increased focus and\nthe reduced communication overhead that is required.\n\nThis same technique works for teams or individuals.  It is easier to\nwork on a complex design that has been subdivided.  Each part can be\nfully developed and tested serially.  This allows the full atention to\nbe placed on one thing at a time.  This will easily save you 20% in\nproject effort wasted on context switching.\n\nThe second area of problem reduction is to solve a smaller problem.\nInstead of solving the full problem, consider how to solve the problem\nthat will yield 80% of the value.  This is likely to take only 20% of\nthe effort.  This is an extremely well-studied phenomenon.\n\nWhen you have solved the 80% problem you often find that the rest of\nthe problem does not even warrant the extra effort at all.  Instead other\nmore pressing design concerns surface that provide a bigger return on\ninvestment.\n\nBeing able to reduce any problem by subdividing and pruning will make\nyou a master at project planning.  Expect and strive for a 100%\nperformance boost in your project outcomes by mastering this important\nskill set.\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Reduce the Problem"}}, {"pk": 34, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/MyBook/Public/Software/TestEverything", "time": "2014-06-15T20:36:02.775", "text": "* Strategic Testing *                 -*-muse-*-\n\n**Reduce your costs**\n\nMost companies do what I call, 'Tactical Testing'.  When a product is getting ready for release we\nexercise the system by trying to make it do everything that it is supposed to do.  This is a necessary\ntype of testing but it stops far short of what is really needed.\n\nIf you want to reduce the cost of your software you should rethink how you test.  There is far more\nat stake than just the cost of testing.  The greater cost of poor testing is market success and\nmaintenance cost for the development team.  Much of what we consider development cost is actually\nrelated to the results of poor testing.\n\n**Strategic Testing Mindset**\n\nAdopting a strategic view of testing requires a significant change in mindset.  This must be driven\nby an understanding of the economics of software development.  At each subsequent stage of the\nlifecyle, defects are significantly more expensive. What takes one minute during design, will take\none hour during code, and a day during the test phase.  If this defect makes it to customers it may\ntake a month to repair the damage.\n\nMost people fail to understand this reality at a gut level so they shift development resources away\nfrom testing to building new features.  As the products mature they produce an intractable\nmaintenance burden on the whole organization.\n\nThe strategic testing mindset is based on four truths.\n 1. Nothing works unless you verify that it works.\n 2. Only automatic testing can be run for reasonable costs.\n 3. Building test infrastructure has huge payoffs over the lifecycle.\n 4. Strategic testing alters both your product architecture and the development process.\n\n**Test everything**\n\nYou may have heard the phrase, \"Trust but verify\". In software develop the maxim should be \"Don't\ntrust, only verify\".  Great software developers create a set of assertions about how things must be.\nThen they constantly test to see if these assertions hold.  When something unexpected occurs they\nconsider it an error.  It may be a false assumption or a defect in the implementation of the\nsystem.\n\nEach action performed should yield the expected result.  And each result should be verified: each\ncommand executed, each file compiled, every database query, and each web page displayed, is an\nopportunity to verify that the world is the way that it ought to be.\n\nIt is easy to believe that testing is someone else's job.  After all, we hire professional testers\nto do the testing and report what they find.  Every defect that is reported represents a potential\nfailure to find and fix during the development.  Our goal should be to have very frustrated testers\nbecause they find so few issues.\n\nIf we have a 'test everything' mentality then we think about development differently.  The\ndevelopment is done in smaller increments.  It is easy to test a small thing but incredibly difficult to test a\nlarge piece of functionality.  Testing itself forces smaller steps.\n\n**Automatic testing**\n\nTests must be easy to run, otherwise they will seldom be repeated.  Testing that requires a huge\ncost will only be executed once.  Any testing requiring many people running manual tests cannot be\nrepeated economically.  On the other hand, if your testing is run every hour automatically, then\ndevelopers receive email whenever something breaks.\n\nI once worked on a project that had 300 testers (mostly non-technical folks) pushing buttons on\nanother continent.  The total development costs were very high due to the lack of automation in the\ntesting process.\n\nConsider developing spheres of testing that can be run at appropriate intervals.  If you don't have\nit in place you should start with monthly, weekly, daily, and hourly tests.  The longer tests may\nhave a longer duration but still not require human effort.  This means that the cost of long-running\ntests can be very low.  \n\nImagine the impact to your project if once a month you could perform comprehensive testing.  You\ncould run a script to clone your production server and use live data.  Obviously, you must be\ncareful about how you do these tests.  But consider the impact of regularly verifying the system\nintegrity at many levels.\n\nBy automating testing you shift the task into the development domain.  This means that testing is\ndesigned to all of the same standards that product code is designed to.  It is debugged until it\nworks properly.  Once debugged it can run every day for the life of the product.\n\n**Building infrastructure**\n\nThis strategy will likely pay for itself during the first development cycle. It takes a lot of\neffort to think through how to put an existing system under test.  New systems are much easier to\nwork with because you can implement best practices from the beginning.\n\nPutting a large system under test, is primarily about exposing key interfaces.  By writing\nscripts to send data to and from interfaces, you will create automation points. These will have many\nother uses for you beyond testing.\n\nConsider building the simplest possible way to get data into an interface.   Think about the natural\nvocabulary that the interface speaks.  Develop a canonical list of verbs and nouns that you use for\neach new interface you visit.  Simple problems have one noun and four verbs.  Real problems have\nmore.\n\nBuild a command interpreter that allows you to stimulate the interface and a data recorder that\nlets you capture the live data.  Think about how to record and playback data in order to remove one\nhalf of the system.\n\nSave data as text.  It is very efficient for version control and writing small data analysis tools.\nEach tool you create will give you new opportunities to interact with your system.  These in turn\nwill guide you through the process of refinement.  This feedback loop will ultimately cut your\nproduct costs in half.\n\n**Product architecture**\n\nStrategic testing will affect your architecture in positive and drastic ways.  What may have been\nburied interfaces become the center of attention.  They become a place for recording the\nconversation of the system and running offline analysis tools.  They may also be a place for\nmonitoring the system health as it is performing its normal operations.\n\nBy bring the key interfaces to the forefront you also have opportunities to separate the parts of\nthe system from each other.  This strategy will lead you to a system that is more loosely coupled.\nRecording and playing back data lets you change how the parts of your system are tested.  But it\nalso lets you optimize how your system is deployed.\n\nEach step that you take lets you make other optimizations.  Each optimization gives you a better\nunderstanding of your system.  Architectural refactoring can greatly extend the life of a system.\nAlmost every company has a million lines of code that no one can modify. This process is your only\nhope to breathing new life into that code.\n\n**Development process**\n\nStrategic testing will have a profound impact on your development process.  You will see a huge\nreduction in the time spent on debugging and maintenance.  Developers will begin finding their own\ndefects rather than someone else having to find them.\n\nMonthly, weekly, and daily testing is used to guarantee that the system always produces the\nexpected answers.  During development additional testing is used on an hourly basis to confirm that\nall of the code being checked in is sound.\n\nAs new code is written, developers should be testing it.  This code can be saved so that it runs as\npart of the hourly test.  If a developer writes a function with five lines of code, then they should\nalso write a couple lines of test code. This prevents defects from being introduced in the future.\n\nBuilding an inventory of test code is a natural result of doing development this way.  It\nallows you to pay for the testing at the same time you pay for the development.  Experienced\nprogrammers using this technique will write more features in the product per day.  \n\nWriting the code the first time is about a break-even for the developers.  But automatic tests allow\nyou to refactor much more aggressively.  The tests provide assurance that you have not broken\nanything. Over the entire product lifecyle, automated testing will generate major cost savings.\n\n**Summary**\n\nAdopting the strategic testing mindset can be extremely hard, but it is well worth it.  Strategic\ntesting enables huge cost savings, by understanding all aspects of your software system. It allows\nyou to build high-quality from the start, and protects your software investment over the long-term.\n\nStrategic testing is even more important with legacy systems.  The effort can be significant, but the\nbenefits far outweigh the costs.\n\nAutomated testing can free you from the gridlock that so frequently undermines software projects and\nrelease resources to focus on invention and business value. \n", "user": 3, "title": "Strategic Testing"}}, {"pk": 35, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/MyBook/Public/Software/DeliverValueSoon", "time": "2014-06-15T20:36:02.943", "text": "* Deliver Value in Two Days *     -*-muse-*-\n\nWhen \"Just in Time Manufacturing\" became popular in the mid-eighties\nthe standard practice was to have warehouses filled with parts\ninventory and finished goods.  It was unthinkable to believe that\ntrucks would pull up on one side of the factory and products would be\nloaded into truck on the other side.\n\nBut as soon as companies demonstrated the ability to reduce inventory\nit became the new accepted practice.  What is unthinkable becomes the\nonly accepted practice once it has been done.\n\nTraditional software projects were unwieldy beasts that never ended.\nThey required large teams and long schedules.  They cost millions or\ndollars and took years.  The first software project that I worked on\ntook 4 1/2 years, with a team of 10 engineers.  How would you like to\npay for that one?\n\nThere are proven methods that can get you to deliver software faster\nand more reliably to your customers.   There are many companies that\nuse these practices and deliver software that rocks, every time!\n\nAnyone can learn these techniques.  They are really quite simple.  But\nnot everyone can embrace them because they require a high degree of\ndiscipline. It is easier to be sloppy in the short-term, and them pay\nthe price in the long-term.\n\nOne revolutionary idea that you can put in practice today is to\ndeliver value faster.  In our manufacturing example, people began to\nview inventory as bad.  It was something that they had paid for\nwithout getting any value in return.\n\nIn software development, uncompleted work is like that.  You paid for\nthe development, but you are not yet ready to get business value from\nit. How long will you wait?  In my first project we waited for about\n40 man years at $100,000 a pop.  Wow, that is a lot of dollars waiting\nfor a return.\n\nThere are three serious problems with having lots of uncompleted work.\n\n  1. You are not getting cash for your effort.  This usually makes the\n     scope increase to get a bigger payoff.\n\n  2. You don't get feedback from customers about what they really\n     want. You try to guess, but you will guess wrong.\n\n  3. You fail to practice the ruthless prioritization that is needed\n     for a short-term payback.\n\nHere is the challenge.  Cut your project schedule in half.  If you\nwork on yearly project consider six months until you get your software\ndeployed.  I've been moving toward shorter-and-shorter payoff cycles\nfor several years.\n\nAt some point you stop calling them project as you view the value\ndelivered as a stream, rather than as a block of functionality.  You\nwill have to develop your own methods of delivery that match your\ncustomer needs.\n\nThe key thing you should always be asking is how can you deliver value\nto real customers faster.  A personal goal that I have is to deliver\nvalue within two days of working on it.\n\nThis forces me into a work mode where I constantly test everything and\ndeliver small incremental improvements on a stable foundation.  I\nthink about every feature that gets added to try to reduce it to a\nstep that can be fully completed within a couple of days.\n\nIf you do this you will steer away from massive development tasks.  At\nthe same time you will become excellent at refactoring and unit\ntesting.  These are essential skills for rapid development.  Imagine\nasking your customer (or your boss) to describe one feature that want\nthe most, then coming back with a working implementation of this\ntomorrow. \n\nOnce you do development this way you will never look back.

The same is\ntrue of software.  Some activities result in direct customer\nvisibility. Other activities are not clearly visible but have a great\nimpact on the overall health of the project.\n\nResist the temptation to ignore the thing that are not readily seen\nand appreciated.  If you yield to pressure to concentrate only on the\nfeatures of the presentation layer, then you will pay in the end.\nRapid progress up to the point where you project implodes does not\nmake you a hero.\n\nAbout half of all your time should be spent on design aspects that are\nnot clearly seen.  Without doing this your design will become brittle\nand impossible to work with.  This involves building unit tests,\nautomation, and refactoring of the code.  This is the price of\ncraftsmanship. \n\nJunior programmers often claim that they are not given permission to\ndo these important tasks.  So in response they attempt to build a\nlarge building without a secure foundation.  Or with our ship analogy\nthey claim that the boss would like them to build more of a barge than\na ship.  Why waist all of the time required to build a proper keel\nand ballasts?\n\nThere is another way to look at this situation. If your boss or\ncustomer only cares about the superstructure, then the only way to\nmaximize that, is to work on the substructure that will support it.\nThis is the approach I usually take.  As a professional developer we\nare being paid for our judgement in knowing how to build something\nthat will last.\n\nIf you are being pressured to take short cuts then get out now before\nthe structure comes down.  No short-term benefit is good enough to\ncreate a long-term disaster.  Sometimes you will have to make\nshort-term compromises to get something running.  But they should be\nfollowed with time of refactoring and testing.\n\nResist the situation where you are always adding to the technical\ndebt.  Every month you must pay of more debt than you create.

Instead they\nuse it as a tactic to keep from having code loss and coordinate\nchanges between several people.  This is a little like using your car\nonly to store household items.\n\nA change in how you use a version control system could facilitate a\nmajor upgrade in your development model as a whole.   It can change\nhow you coordinate work, perform automated testing, and manage your\nproject planning.\n\nOver the last several years I have been thoroughly studying my\ndevelopment practices. Examining each aspect of my daily routine has\nyielded some surprises.  I found that I was spending a lot of mind\nshare on my files.\n\nWhere are they and what are they doing?  Where have they been and\nwhere are they going?  Have any of my files fallen on hard times?  How\ndoes each part of the system fit with the whole?  These are the\nquestions that you need a version control system to manage for you.\n\nFiles can no longer be managed as individuals.  There are way too many\nfor that.  They must be treated with policies.  The first step in the\nstrategic use of version control, is to make sure that your software\nsupports change sets.\n\nYou should never think about an individual file version.  It should\nalways be a collective set of file versions that are built into a\nsingle change set.  Each change set is a working snapshot of your\nsystem.  It is tested, and to the best of your knowledge, it is\nworking properly.  Whether you changed one or ten thousand files, your\nchange set is all that you really trust.\n\nWhen you commit a set of changes to version control, you are making a\nstatement that the new thing is better than the old.  Only commit what\nyou trust to version control.\n\nTo share your changes with others you will periodically push.  Only\npush your changes when you are ready to defend them in the court of\npeer review.  Why would you want to push bad things?\n\nDevelop everything with a session model.  Create your work products,\ntest it, and commit your changes.  While you are working you will have\nmany files with pending changes.  At the end of your session you will\nhave committed all of your pending changes. \n\nThis provides a point of closure for your work.  It also lets you\nfocus on one thing until it is done.  This is vitally important while\nprogramming because most programming errors are the result of\ndistractions. \n\nA work session begins when you desire to fullfill a goal on your\nproject.  Try to limit your session to an hour.  Make your commits\nmatch your specific goals.  This will mean that you are creating a new\ncommit each hour and that your pending files should be very fresh.\nConstantly push for done.\n\nTo gather changes from others you should pull their changes.  If the\ncode does not work with yours you need to stop everything else and\ntroubleshoot the issue.  Enlist the help of the person that caused the\nproblem so that they can be trained not to in the future.\n\nThere are four essential operations in a strategic version control:\n * **changes** - show the pending changes\n * **commit** - commit the pending changes\n * **pull** - get changes from others\n * **push** - share changes with others\n\nMake sure that these essential operations are promenant in the sea of\ncommands that you use for managing branches, labeling version,\nmerging, etc..\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Stragtegic Version Control"}}, {"pk": 42, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/MyBook/Public/Software/FightBitRot", "time": "2014-06-15T20:36:04.326", "text": "* Fight Bit Rot *                 -*-muse-*-\n\nHow to keep software entropy from destroying your project.\n\n**What is bit rot?**\n\nSoftware is almost always created with high quality.   But it lives in a constantly changing world.\nThis means that as it ages it must constantly be changed to match the new world.\n\nIf the software changes cannot keep up with the changing environment then problems grow and multiply\nwithin the software.  The longer a piece of software exists the more dramatic the bit rot.  \n\nThe other problem with aging software is that the original team members slowly fade away and the\nknowledge required to keep the system updated is lost.  As this happens the system becomes more\nbrittle and fragile.\n\n\n**The crisis**\n\nEveryone wants a software system to be flexible, but this does not naturally occur.  The only way to\nmake a system flexible, is to constantly flex it.\n\nHave you ever worked in a shared space and noticed how messy it becomes over time?  This is because\nno one feels a sense of ownership. As code has many authors it becomes more like a messy public\nspace than a sign of craftsmanship.\n\nDifferent people have different goals for a system.  They also have different programming and design\nstyles that they inflict upon the overall system.  The more authors that a software system has, then\nthe more dramatic the mess becomes.\n\nEventually, the code takes on so much technical debt that it can not be maintained for a reasonable\ncost.   At this point the entire system is scrapped and a new one is built to replace it. \n\nThere are a variety of reasons given for replacing the old system, but the actual cause is that the\nsystem has been taken over by \"bit rot\".  \n\nSoftware neglect can result in enormous costs to a business. This problem is incredibly pervasive in\nall industries.  Bit rot threatens to destroys our core business value.\n\n\n**The cure**\n\nFortunately, there are very effective methods for fighting bit rot.  There are principles and\npractices that that guarantee a longer life for existing software system.  Learning these techniques\ncan protect a large software investment.\n\nThese four areas will dramatically extend the useful life of your software.\n\n 1. Automate your testing\n 2. Refactor ruthlessly\n 3. Fix all known problems\n 4. Make changes incrementally\n\nAutomate your testing\n\nIf your test cannot be run automatically then they will not be run very often.  Only automatic\ntesting can be used to give you the confidence that your code is running properly.  Hiring an army\nof people to push buttons and right down results is a very bad business decision.  Your full battery\nof tests should run at least once a day.\n\nRefactor ruthlessly\n\nOnce you have tests in place you can confidently modify your code.  Your tests will tell you when\nanything breaks in your code.  This lets you make very dramatic changes to the structure of your\ncode without introducing any new defects.  The design and functionality of your code can be changed\nto match the changes in the environment.\n\nFix all known problems\n\nThe longer problems are in a system the greater the damage will be.  Bugs breed!  Every effort\nshould be made to address design and coding flaws as quickly as they are discovered.  Set goals and\ntrack metrics for how long it takes to remove problems.\n\nMake changes incrementally\n\nStart with a baseline of functionality.  Create tests to ensure that the system always remains\nrunning.  If the system ever gets worse then revert the changes and try again. Every change that you\nmake to the system should improve both the structure and the functionality of your system.\nConstantly be adding tests to the areas that you are working in to ensure that any problems that you\nintroduce are discovered quickly.\n\n\n**Core practices**\n\nAutomatic system test\n\nYou should have a text-based language of some kind that you can use to stimulate your system.  By\nusing this you can exercise all of the features within your software. The text lets you develop a\ncollection of source code scripts that can easily be merged together.  \n\nTo test your entire system all you need to do is run this collection of scripts and look for the\nfamiliar output.  This technique scales very well to large and complex systems.  Many specific tests\ncan be written as a single line of code.\n\nUnit testing\n\nA unit test is written to test how a function behaves in isolation.  These are typically written at\nthe same time that the product code is turned on.  A typical function of four lines should have two\ntest cases that excercise a couple of paths through the function.  Each test case should be a single\nline of code.  Most people don't use unit tests because they make them too complex.  Keep it simple,\nbut do it every time.\n\nDevelopment loop\n\nHow you construct your development loop, determines how maintainable your code will be three years\nfrom now.  A proper development loop starts with designing the test.  How will you verify that the\nfeature works? \n\nThinking of the test first does two things for you.  It guarantees that your code works properly\nnow. It also guarantees that you will know when you accidently break this function in the future. If\nyou build this type of testing as you go then you can ensure that your whole system is testable.\n\nStrategic version control\n\nVersion control is one of the most underutilized tools in the toolbox.  Every engineer should be\nable to work on many branches of code simultaneously without confusing them.  Choose a best-in-class\nversion control system like Git and make sure that every engineer is well trained on how to use\nit. Configuration management issues can easily eat up 25% of the time for your development team.\n\n\n**Summary**\n\nIf you pay attention to your software development process then bit rot will be replaced by a\nsoftware that just gets better over time.\n\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Fight Bit Rot"}}, {"pk": 43, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/MyBook/Public/Software/Title", "time": "2014-06-15T20:36:04.532", "text": "* World-class Software *                   -*-muse-*-\n Creating software that rocks!\n \n By Mark Seaman\n http://software.shrinking-world.org\n \n", "user": 3, "title": "World-class Software"}}, {"pk": 44, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/MyBook/Public/Software/TestDriven", "time": "2014-06-15T20:36:04.733", "text": "* Testing is Central to Development *      -*-muse-*-\n\nI know a lot of professional software developers that write a lot of\ncode and then try to debug it.  This is slow way to develop software\nfor three primary reasons.\n\nIt is easier to get a small amount of code working.  Complexity is not\nlinear in its impact, it is closer to the square.  It is around nine\ntimes harder to turn on a piece of code that is three times the\nsize.\n\nIf you test and fix everything as you go then the bug is in the piece\nof code that you just modified.  If this is limited to three lines of\ncode then you don't have to hunt to find the problem.\n\nYou cannot possibly remember all of the nuances of your systen and how\nit is supposed to work.  Automated tests encapsulate all of this\ninportant knowlege so that you don't have to remember it.  Running\nyour tests often ensures that everything is still in working order.\n\nThe speed of development is limited by the speed of your testing.  How\nfast will you discover the bug that you are about to introduce 15\nminutes from now?  If you answer is 15 seconds you are on the right\ntrack.  If it is fifteen hours, or fifteen days you are in serious\ntrouble.\n\nDefect breed.  A bug that lives in your system for days will have\ngrand children with major consequences to your stability.  You will\nstart writing defensive programs because your can not longer trust the\nbasic system integrity.\n\nConsider three levels of automated testing.  Build up a test that\nverifies the full operation of your system.  This test ensures that\nthe core value of your complete system is always entact.  This test\nmay run overnight and should be run each night.\n\nNext each subsystem of your top level system should have an automated\ntest that verifies all of the nuances of the system under\ndevelopment.  This guarantees that none of the interfaces have been\nbroken.  This test should run within the context of the entire\napplication but focus on a particular subsystem.  This test should run\nin less that 15 minutes.\n\nThe third level of automated testing that you should have allows you\nto experiment with an isolated piece of your system.  While the first\ntwo levels use the code in the context of the whole system this type\nof testing lets you run parts of your system in isolation.\n\nWhen a problem appears you should immediately switch to this type of\ntesting to find out why the failure is occurring.  It is much more\ndifficult to diagnose problems when the whole system could be at\nfault.  Use the data flow through the system to pinpoint the failing\npart and then run that part in isolation to closely observe its\nbehavior.\n", "user": 3, "title": "Testing is Central to Development"}}, {"pk": 45, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/MyBook/Public/WatermillSupportTools", "time": "2014-06-15T20:36:04.952", "text": "* Watermill Support Tools Builders Guide *                                       -*-muse-*-\n\n**Watermill Support Tools**\n\nWST refers to the system for creating pages that have live connections to system scripts.\nThis system allows engineers to easily write tools that display live reports of actual\ndata.\n\nWST is built on top of Watermill Diagnostics (WMD), which is the engine for displaying a\ndocument tree. Every page within WMD loads a document from the tree and formats it\naccording to a set of rules.\n\nWMD provides special formatting for headings, links, bullets, and tabs.  Watermill Support\nTools (WST) extends WMD to allow the pages to contain embedded scripts.\n\nWhen a page loads any scripts that are referenced are executed.  The output is captured\nand formatted as a part of the rendered page.  There are also some special tools for\ncontrolling the output format of the pages.\n\n**Watermill Scripts**\n\nNot every script can be run within a page.  The scripts to be executed by WST page must be\ndesigned and debugged by the engineering team.  These approved scripts are then added to\nthe library of scripts and can be used in any page.\n\nThe script library is located in '~/wmd-scripts' directory.  This library contains several\nsubdirectories.  Let's look at these one at a time.\n\n\n**~/wmd-scripts/system**\n\nThe scripts that are available to every web page in WST are located in this directory.\nEach of these scripts can be accessed by a page document with an embedded script tag.\n\nFor example: \n    [ [SCRIPT:system/test-table] ]\n\nThis will create a table of formatted data that is formatted as HTML.\n\nEvery script should begin with '#!/bin/bash' in order to tell which program the script is\nwritten for.   '#!/usr/bin/env python' is used to setup python programs.\n\nGo to the system directory and review the scripts that are available at this time.\n\n\n**~/wmd-scripts/fleet**\n\nThis directory contains pages that are used to execute scripts.  These pages contain\nreferences to scripts from the system directory.\n\nFleet pages present reports for managing the entire fleet (not a single mill).  Fleet page\ntypically invoke a script that generates a formatted report.\n\nGo to the system directory and review the pages that are available at this time.\n\n\n**~/wmd-scripts/mill**\n\nThis directory contains scripts that will be executed on a remote watermill.   The scripts\nare distributed to the remote watermills by another mechanism.\n\nEvery script should begin with '#!/bin/bash' in order to tell which program the script is\nwritten for.   '#!/usr/bin/env python' is used to setup python programs.\n\nA remote script can be executed by the following syntax in the page.\n    [ [SCRIPT:mill/sc-milldo/$unit/get_disk_space] ]\n\nGo to the mill directory and review the scripts that are available at this time.\n\n\n**push-master**\n\nPush master will replicate all of the pages in the ~/wmd-scripts/mill directory for all\nunit numbers.   Later development will collapse out this intemediate step.\n\nThe code replicator will replace '$unit' with the actual unit number for each unit.  For\nexample:\n    [ [SCRIPT:mill/sc-milldo/$unit/get_disk_space] ]\nbecomes\n    [ [SCRIPT:mill/sc-milldo/3006/get_disk_space] ]\n\nPush master is a script that can be embedded in a page to replicate the unit pages.\n    [ [SCRIPT:system/push-master] ]\n\n\n**~/data/wmd/unit**\n\nAt the time of execution, the WST system will set up for executing the script on the right\nunit number based on what page is being loaded.   This lets the script writer focus on the\nscript logic, rather than unit selection.\n\nGo to the unit directory for 3006 and review the pages that are available at this time.\n\n\n**Page Format**\n[[HTML\nHeadings   '* This header *'\nBullets    ' * list item 1'\nTabs       '* *Tab name* *'\n]]\n\n\n**Links**\nWikiWork\n[[thisPage]]\n[[thisPage][This page text]]\nhttp://google.com\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Watermill Support Tools Builders Guide"}}, {"pk": 46, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/MyBook/Public/Index", "time": "2014-06-15T20:36:05.150", "text": "* Welcome to Shrinking World On-line *                 -*-muse-*-\n\nThis web site is dedicated to providing you with high quality\ninformation to help you be more effective in the modern world\n\nEmail me to get notifications of updated materials\n<a href=\"mailto://mark.seaman@shrinking-world.org\">Mark Seaman</a>\n\n\n**Software Engineering**\n\nPresentations\n\n    [[ShrinkingWorld/FCIP][Ft.

Our answer is\ntypically to try to respond to as many of the demands as possible.  But this is a perilous course!\n\nYesterday, I found myself overwhelmed by several demands for my attention.  Without even thinking\nabout it I started answering serveral emails, checking a calendar, looking up a phone, number,\nmonitoring a test that was running and trying to fix a defect that a previous test revealed.\n\nSuddenly, I was aware that the stack was seven levels deep.  Stop this train I want off!  The\nquality of work greatly decreases as your attention is drawn into multiple acitivities. In my case,\nthis is what finally alerted me to the blunder of attention deficit.\n\nWe live in a busy world, with constant demands placed on us.  We can not do anything about the rate\nthat the demands are made for our attention.  But we can manage how we choose to respond to those\ndemands. \n\nThink of a person that you work with that is incapable of managing the demands on their time.  They\nthing that they are working on at this moment is related to the last conversation that they had.\nOver time you can not rely on them to do anything in a predictable way.\n\nMany of us feel that multitasking is the only way that we can respond to constant demands.  But\nthere is a more effective way to service inputs from others faster.  Make a list of everything that\ndemands your attention.  It is very quick to write down a phrase: \"buy tires\", \"write TPS report\",\n\"hire hit man\".  But doing so will allow you to remember what needs to get done without breaking\nyour concentration.\n\nWhen you finish one task go to your list to pick out the next action needed.  Select the one with\neither the greatest urgency or importance.  Attempt to complete any activity before starting on the\nnext one.\n\nMany studies have shown that working on several things at once is less effective that working on\nthem serially.  What surprises me is the level of energy that goes into switching between the\ncontexts. When switching between multiple tasks you will consume 10-20% of your attention for\nswitching (depending on the complexity of the task). \n\nThis means that if you are trying to fit two tasks into one brain you will be able to put 35-40% of\nyour attention on each one. For three tasks this decreases to 10-25% each.  Think about this.  You\nmay be spending over half of your total mental energy before you even begin to do the actual work.\n\nI believe that multitasking is the number one source of stress in both our personal and work lives.\nHere's a challenge.  Try single-tasking for a single day. It is hard but, once you succeed, you will\nnever go back.\n\n--- \n\nReply to this message if you wish to eliminate future email messages.

This is often misunderstood by\npeople that work with ideas for a living.  Our instinct is to hide ideas thinking that they are\nassets that can be protected.  \n\nIdeas are a network of connections that have no real impact in isolation.  Protection is the wrong\ngoal because more connections are made when sharing with others. Ideas in isolation starve to death.\nBut sharing causes them to grow stronger as more connections are made.\n\nCollaboration is a great way to build trust. Relationships are built on trust and sharing ideas\ndemonstrates your desire to trust.  In return others instinctively trust you more.  If you allow\nothers to influence you, this also increases trust. Collaboration is a consistent habit of giving\nand receiving.  Both of these actions grow trust.\n\nBuild stronger ideas by exposing them to multiple people. Ideas are refined as others are exposed to\nyour thinking.  Unchallenged assumptions are dangerous and inevitable, if you never open up to\nothers.\n\nSelf-deception is easy to prevent.  It all starts with an openness to share what you know. The level\nof synergy that results is often surprising.   We always generate more when we work together.\n\nA half-baked idea can easily turn into a winner by discussing it with a friend.  Get value by\ncollaborating with others.  You don't have to generate everything yourself.  It takes a village to\nfully develop a plan, concept, or project.\n\nOthers have resources you need.  By trusting them with what you know you create a partnership that\nwill take you much further than you could go alone.  Make it your goal to never attempt anything\nalone.  Why not bring along a companion and collaborator?  There is always enough to share at the\nend when you win together.\n\nInfluence is the highest goal for ideas. Your desire should be to make the world a better place by\nusing what you know.  Convert weak and fruitless ideas, into powerful ideas that can change some\ncorner of the world.  This will only be realized by the power of collaboration.\n\n\n\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "The Power of Collaboration"}}, {"pk": 49, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/MyBook/Public/SeamansLog/LearningCurve", "time": "2014-06-15T20:36:05.796", "text": "* Climbing the learning curve *                 -*-muse-*-\n\nThere are five distinct stages of learning a new skill.  Each of these is qualitatively different\nthan the last.  You ask different questions and have new levels of autonomy.  The context for\nsuccess varies a great deal as you progress through the stages.\n\nThese stages are related to specific skills.  Therefore it is possible to be an expert in real-time control\nand a novice in web development.  Knowledge in one domain does not automatically translate into\nanother.  But there may be overlap of the knowledge needed for different skills.\n\n\nNovice\n\nThe novice knows very little and requires a recipe to follow.  They are unable to make progress when the\ncurrent situation does not match the recipe.  This is the entry level for the first time that each\nnew skill has been used.  A novice works by rote, without creating a conceptual model.\n\nA person may continue to be a novice after many uses of a skill if they have not encountered any\ndifferent situations along the way.  A person progresses by understanding how to deal with the\nunexpected.\n\n\nAdvanced Beginner\n\nThe advanced beginner can deviate from the recipe when needed. You feel like you understand why the\nrecipe was created and can troubleshoot simple problems that occur.  A beginner follows the recipe,\nbut knows how to change it when variations are needed.\n\nTo be a beginner you have completed at least one project with this knowledge. You are in the process\n of creating a mental model for how to apply the knowledge.  This requires that you have seen\n several different variations of the task and know when to change the recipe.\n\n\nCompetent\n\nA competent person in a given skill can create rules of thumb for others.  Enough situations have\nbeen experienced that a general model has developed.  Unfortunately these models tend to be\noverly simple.\n\nA competent person believes that everything has a simple answer and does not know how to recognize\nwhen the standard rules to not apply.  A competent person develops simple recipes and rules for\nothers.   They have seen several projects and are able to recognize standard patterns that apply\n\n\nProficient\n\nThe proficient person recognizes the effect of context over the problem.  They see the nuances of\nany given situation and are frustrated that others can not.  Their solutions tend to embody the\ncomplexity of the world as they see it.\n\nThe proficient person sees that solutions are tied to context. They recognize that no one rule\n applies in every situation.  They often build complex solutions to simple problems because they\n understand how much things can vary.  They reject previously create models from others as\n being naive.  This level might be the best teachers.\n\n\nExpert\n\nExperts operate mostly by intuition rather than rules.  They need absolute freedom within their area\nof expertise to create.  They often have a hard time explaining the motivation for their actions to\nothers.  Intuition is often the highest level of reasoning.\n\nThe expert knows the answer by intuition, without following a chain  of rules.

Opposing them is like trying to hold back the\nocean tide.  Make sure that you are always on the correct side of a trend. For those who are aware\nof it, a trend presents lots of new opportunity. Here are four trends that you should anticipate and\ntake advantage of.\n\n\n**Global communication**\n\nTwenty years ago it was not very practical to have teams of people that worked from different\nlocations.  Today, that is the norm.  Even when people are co-located, they spend most of their time\nworking with virtual tools and remote partners.  In the future, most teams will be connected\nvirtually.  It will be unusual to have teams that meet together physically to conduct all of their\nbusiness.\n\nThis trend is an opportunity for people that know how to work effectively across distance,\ntime-zones, and cultures.  The work force of the future is made of people that know how to get\nthings done remotely.  These people are skilled at developing teamwork by effectively using tools to\nremove communication barriers.\n\n\n**Free distribution of information**\n\nThe internet has given us universal access to information.  It allows us to learn anything we need\nto learn instantly.  It also allows us to provide information quickly and economically to\neveryone.  This is a profound change that will alter everything about how we share information.\n\nThere is a lot of poor quality information that swamps the internet. Producing high-quality content\nis the best way to rise above the din of noise.  The people that will win are those that can best\nmeet the needs of others, by producing timing info that people can use.\n\n\n**Project-based work**\n\nIn a past era, the safest career path was to find a large successful company and work there for your\nwhole life.  That option no longer exists for most people.  The new workplace is composed of a sea\nof contractors.  Each person enters the marketplace with a certain set of skills and barters for a\nchance to use those skills.\n\nPeople that do a great job, get another game token and get to play again.  This means that every\nworker is responsible for their own personal and professional development.  You cannot rely on\nanyone else to show you the path to success.  You must identify the opportunities that are the best\nfit for your particular skills, and pursue them.\n\n\n**Tactical partnerships**\n\nJust like lifetime employment, long-term partnerships may have changed.  In a volatile world, we need\nmore flexibility.  Over the past years, we have seen a sharp increase in tactical partnerships.\nThese are formed in order to work together on a specific project.  The partnership is built around a\ncommon interest and business goal.\n\nFor these types of business relationships it is very important to agree on the specific\nexpectations, and the extent of the cooperation.  When successful, these cooperative partnerships\nmay go on for many years.  The key is that they are based on short-term mutual interest.\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Anticipating Important Trends"}}, {"pk": 51, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/MyBook/Public/SeamansLog/CreateYourOwnBlog", "time": "2014-06-15T20:36:06.149", "text": "* Create Your Own Blog *                 -*-muse-*-\n\nIt has never been easier to create your own blog.

My geeky friends disagree, because they just like messing with\ncomputers.\n\nCreate a blog around a topic that you feel passionate about.  Select an area where you feel like you\nhave a unique viewpoint that you want to share with others.  Consider your writing as an enjoyable\npasstime, not a business venture.\n\nDon't worry about who will read it now.

This company is one of the greatest success\nstories of the 20th century.  It dominated entire segments of the market and had a large role in\nfounding Silicon Valley.  Many other companies have their roots in HP.   The domination of the\nprinter business will be studied in biz schools for the next century.\n\nWhat is the secret for making a great company?  At their core they are all built on sound principles\nand best practices. Both Bill and Dave were giants when it came to innovations in business and\nmanaging people.  The success of HP over decades is directly related to the principles and practices\nthey believed in.\n\n**Building a great company can be repeated**\n\nGreat companies are based on a simple recipe.  It is easy to understand the principles that are at\ntheir heart.  However, applying these ideas can be extremely difficult.  This is why so many\ncompanies settle for lip-service rather than application.\n\nPeople are the answer.  It is important to have people believe these ideas to the extent that their\nactions change.  Belief without behavior benefits no one.  In fact, it is not really belief at all.\nThis problem is all too common in businesses today.\n\nGreat companies are constantly learning.  Business conditions are changing every day.  What worked\nin the past may not work in the future. Learning is everything.  Stagnation can be deadly in business.\n\n**No free pass to ongoing success**\n\nJim Collins wrote two very interesting books.  In \"Good to Great\", he defines how certain companies\nachieve greatness.  In \"How the Mighty Fall\", he explores the path of how great companies fail.\n\nJust because a company is great today, there is no assurance that it will be great in the future.\nSuccess depends directly on practices that make you great.  Even the strongest company can decay if\nit stops doing the things that matter most.\n\n**Responding to current challenges**\n\nIn the last few years, everything has changed.  The road to the Great American Dream is blocked for\nmany.  I work with a lot of young adults, and am alarmed by how hard it is to succeed in our culture\nnow.  My kids and their peers have a much more difficult time than we did as young adults.\n\nWe need new examples for success.  These must be built on the same set of principles that made HP\ngreat.  But the conditions are so radically different, that we need a new set of practices: ones that\nwork in the modern world.\n\nWhat worked in past decades will no longer work.  Lifetime employment with a large company, full\nbenefits package, and a pension are gone forever.  We need new models of success that can be\nemulated by the emerging generation.\n\nThese models must be built through constant experimentation.  I am dedicating the next ten years\ntoward learning how to create reproducible business models.  These models could be easily copied by\nsmall groups of people to create new successful businesses.\n\n**Call to action**\n\nI am going to be using my company, Shrinking World Solutions, as both a laboratory and showcase for these\nbusiness ideas.  Our company will be sharing both our successes and failures as freely as possible\nin order to benefit others.\n\nI invite you to join us in the journey.

Analyze, search and destroy. This is not complex but it is\nhard work, requiring discipline. It is totally worth the effort.  Make every small investment pay\nfor itself before you start another improvement. Switch your attitude from \"tolerate\" to \"eliminate\"\nwhen it comes to waste.

Keeping a log of every task you do may help\nyou find waste.\n\nHow do you invest the savings?  Resist the temptation to work less.  Instead put the time that you\nsave into new tools, automation, and learning.  These will compound into future saving.  Your career\nwill take off as your effectiveness increases.  You will be able to accomplish much more with the\nsame level of effort.\n\nChoose to spend money in order to save time.  Calculate the value of one hour of your time. Be\nwilling to spend your own money to redeem your time.  You will find that you can pay for a new\ncomputer system in a single day of your time.  This assumes that you can get a the cheap computer\nthat will do some important task for you.\n\nDon't hesitate to buy tools that will save you time.  Go through the calcualation of how many hours\nyou need to save in order to justify a new tool. Include the cost of setup and learning in the\nbreak-even calculation. Most of these decisions are fairly obvious when you take the time to think\nit through.\n\nStudy habits of people you admire. Identify your productivity heroes. Learn their secrets. Also study\nyour specific problem areas and what solutions might work for you.  Finally, share your secrets with\nothers.  They may already have solved your problems.

How do I plan to\nspend them?  I've been working diligently on this question for the last month and have finally\narrived at the answer.\n\nThe subject of work/life balance means different things for each person.  For some it brings up\nstrong feelings of resentment caused by the insatiable demands of an employer or family members.  For\nothers it is a call to get back to work.  Since work is my drug of choice, it is a mandate to spend\nmore time on Facebook, or watching kittens on YouTube.\n\nBalancing work and life is mostly about investing our life in the things that we actually value.\nMoney is important because it allows us to do other things, like eat or live indoors. This brings us\nto the first decision point.   How much time will we spend working as a percentage of our overall\nlife?\n\nWe have roughly 100 waking hours to budget each week. I intend to spend half this time on all forms\nof work combined.  This leaves the remaining 50 hours for all the different types of play activities.\n\nThe second choice you make is related to private or public activities.  You have a certain amount of\ntime that you must work for others versus providing for the needs of your family.   In the same way,\nplay activities may be built around other people, or for the purpose of individual enjoyment.\n\nI find my balance by spending 25% of my time in each of these quadrants: Working for my\nfamily, Working for others, Playing by myself, Building relationships.\n\nSince half of all the time is spend working you can substitute the hours spent working for the\nactual money that you spend in your budget.  I use the following categories:\n\nWork for us: Housing expenses, Living expenses, Savings   (25 hours/week)\n\nWork for others: Tax, Church, Community service  (25 hours/week)\n\nPlay for us: Vacation, Entertainment, Personal growth  (25 hours/week)\n\nPlay with others: Family time, Friends time, Social networking  (25 hours/week)\n\nYou need to configure your own life budget based on what you most value.  Here is a simple way to do\nit.  You can complete this task in about a half hour, plus a week while you argue with yourself and\nyour spouse.\n\nSelect twenty tokens (use poker chips, m&ms or coins).  Each token represents five hours of your time\nweekly.  Use two kinds of tokens for work and play.  Write the twelve categories of things that you\nwant to spend time on every week.  Allocate the tokens according to what you value most.\n\nSmaller goals can be combined into other categories that you are more committed to.  The smallest\nlevel of ongoing investment is five hours every week. Things that take a couple of hours weekly do\nnot show up at this level.  Group them with another category.  Notice that \"Living Expenses\" is my\ncatch-all bucket for spending.\n\nThis exercises will teach you three things. 1. You will understand how much work you intend to\ndo. 2. You will know how your work time is converted into actual life goals. 3. You will realize the\nideal balance for meeting the needs of others compared to your own personal needs.\n\nNo one answer is right for everyone, but there is an answer that is right for you and your family.\nLive long and prosper!\n", "user": 3, "title": "10,000 Shopping Days Left"}}, {"pk": 57, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/MyBook/Public/SeamansLog/NewYearsResolutions", "time": "2014-06-15T20:36:07.338", "text": "* How New Year's Resolutions Harm *                 -*-muse-*-\n\nWe all want to change, but New Year's Resolutions can backfire.\n\nConsider these four reasons for why they can harm you...\n\n 1. New habits are based on quick success\n\n 2. Setting goals annually is not often enough\n\n 3. We are tempted to dream instead of acting\n\n 4. Failing at a big goal produces hopelessness\n\nMotivation is the key to change.  And there is nothing more inspiring than an easy win.  It gives you\na desire for more.  \n\nWhy not use this process to rig changes in your favor.  Create a series of small steps that let you\nexperience the thrill of success over and over. \n\nMake small goals that you know you can acheive.  Constantly be aiming for smaller gains.  But attain\nthem faster.  Daily goals are much more effective at producing large changes than annual ones.\n\nIf something is worth doing, it is worth doing now!  Why wait for a whole year before committing to\nnew goals.  Because January is the month of new commitments, February is often the month of\ndisappointment and self-loathing.\n\nFoget this annnual madness.  Resolve to not make any more New Year's resolutions.  Instead commit to\ndaily process of following your dreams.  Get in touch with what you really want from life.  Then\nbegin to make a little bit of that happen every day.\n\nDreaming is only valuable if it leads to action.  Broken dreams are just extra disappointments that\nact as fuel for the bonfire of our lives. \n\nGoals that we cannot meet are demotivating.  Instead of creating big plans, choose the right\ndirection.  Then set off by systematically acting in a way to move you in that direction.  Plot a\ndirection, not the full course.  This is a shift from \"planning\" to \"preparation\".\n\nAt each step choose the smallest thing that you could be satified with. You will quickly find\nyourself doing more and more.

It is simply the ugly reality that we must all deal with.  But Gmail\nlet's you say goodby to all of your spam problems.\n\nGmail is an outstanding piece of work that is freely available to anyone.  I have been using it for\nthe past three years as my only email solution for both personal and business accounts.\n\nI used to spend an ennormous amount of time messing with my email folders, backups, and spam\nfiltering.  Once I started using Gmail that all stopped.  Over the years I have used many different\nemail applcations.   Each of these presented its own unique challenges that required monitoring and\nfiddling with.\n\nThe most important email issue is spam filtering.  How can you reliably separate the real email from\nthe unsolicited garbage that shows up every day?  When I was in the corporate world, I processed\nabout 200 email messages each day.  Only about half of these were things that I needed to deal with.\nThe rest was garbage.\n\nWhat makes Gmail so amazing is how the email is treated by the servers. Google is the world master\nat understanding data by looking at it.  They use these techniques to create excellent spam\nfiltering capabilities in gmail.\n\nA sizable fraction of all email traffic goes through Google.  This allows them to have carefully\ntuned algorithms to detect spam.  Many spam generaters send to several million email addresses.\nThese messages are easily recognized as spam at Google.\n\nWhen Gmail sees many copies of the same message or when clients flag a message as spam then the\nmessage is removed for everyone.  This is cause for exhuberant celebration or at least a hearty cheer.\n\nI have around 20 email addresses used for various things.  These are all redirected to Gmail so that\nI can have one in-box serve all of my email needs.  I feel confident to post my email addresses\neverywhere on the web since gmail does such a good filtering job.\n\nAnother valuable feature of Gmail is how your email is saved and backed up by Google.  They keep\nraising the limits of space allowed for each user. I currently use about 5% of my allotment.  There\nis no way that Google is going to lose your data.  I cannot say the same for other methods of storage.\n\nDeleted messages are automatically saved for sixty days allowing you to change your mind. You can\nmake rules to automatically sort mail by topic.  This reduces how many messages are placed in the\nin-box.  You can read the sorted folders later when you have time an interest.  It takes about 10\nseconds to create a new rule.\n\nGmail can get you up and running in about ten minutes.  But don't underestimate the power of the\nsolution.  Google has created the best email solution available and provides it for free.  If you\nare not currently using Gmail you are really missing out.\n", "user": 3, "title": "Gmail features that save the most time"}}, {"pk": 60, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/MyBook/Public/SeamansLog/ReadToLearn", "time": "2014-06-15T20:36:07.967", "text": "* Books are the fastest way to learn *                 -*-muse-*-\n\nThis may seem either controversial or obvious to you, depending on your recent experience.  There\nare a lot of alternatives to help you learn.  To learn something new, try to find the most effective\nresources.  Reading for enjoyment and to learn are two very different activities.\n\nCreating a book requires a great deal of time compared to developing resources on the internet. The\npower of the internet makes it is very easy to produce material.  This may be great if you are\ntracking breaking events from large numbers of sources.  But it can also be a liability.  Much of\nthe information written for the internet is of low quality.\n\nBooks, on the other hand, require hundreds of hours of deliberation.  A blogger can write an article\nof 300 words as fast as it can be typed in.  It may take someone about 10 minutes to share their\nthoughts and opinions with you.  You may be relying on the accuracy of content that does not have\nmuch real thought behind it.\n\nThe very fact that books are hard to create means that serious thought and effort have gone into\ncreating them.  Presumably, they are worth the effort. If what you really need is to learn a new\nsubject in a short period of time, your best bet is a great book on the subject.\n\nBooks can be read many different ways.  In learning mode, consider spending an hour skimming\nthe entire book.  This will give you the big idea.  That may be all the you need.  Congratulations!\nYou just read a book in an hour and learned a new subject.\n\nIn your second pass study the table of contents.  Figure out what questions you still need answers\nfor.  Pick out a few subject areas that to explore in more detail.  Read these areas and forget the\nrest.\n\nYour third pass is to understand how to apply the information.  You should prepare a set of\nquestions.  How can you apply this knowledge on your own?  Where do you disagree with the author?\nWhat might you have added?\n\nStudy these areas in detail.  Focus on areas that give you the most benefit in the shortest time.\nMake notes that would let you teach someone just like you.  Create a short description of what you\nlearned.\n\nAfter you have studied the content, the table of contents and index are excellent ways to jump right\nto a specific topic.  The table of contents gives you the high-level view of everything that the\nauthor says. I always read this first when looking for the general structure of topics.  The index\nis a great reference tool for finding specifics.\n\nMost authors write multiple books to share their body of knowledge.  Follow your favorite author.\nIf you resonate with what they say, you are likely to enjoy other things they write as well.\n\n--- \n\nSend me email if you wish to unsubscribe to future messages.

Last year I encountered just such a book.  As a writer, software\nconsultant, and inventor I work in a world of ideas.  Books are one of the richest sources of\nlearning available.\n\nA good book presents new ideas not readily available anywhere else.  So many books now are simply a\nrehash of things that many others have already said.  The ideas must apply directly to my\nsituation.  Some books have great ideas that are just not useful to me.\n\nA really excellent book can be read and understood at four different levels.  In the first hour you\ncan skim a book and understand the big idea that is presented.  Some books are only worth this level\nof investment.  Go to the library or book store, and conduct this first pass skim before you purchase\nit.\n\nThe first three chapters of a non-fiction book (or sometimes the first chapter of each section)\ncontain the details of the subject.  They offer explanation, examples, and insight on how to apply\nthe big idea.\n\nSome books are worth reading \"cover to cover\".  These books are crammed with insights that you must\nponder and digest over a period of time.  Spend at least 10 hours on a 200 page book if it is worth\nit. But in return, demand that you get at least twice as much benefit as the effort that you invest.\n\nFinally, there are some books worth analyzing in detail.  I study these books and start new\nprojects to experiment with the ideas presented.  I read, reread, study, make notes, and discuss\nthese topics with my friends.\n\nThis last year, I encountered \"Pragmatic Thinking and Learning\", by Andy Hunt.  From the moment I\nstarted reading it, I knew it was special.  He describes how the brain works, and how you can use this\nunderstanding to become more effective at everything.  \n\nSeveral discussions within the book sparked new areas of research for me.  I launched a project to\nimplement an information management system, that I call the \"exterior brain\". I was inspired to create\nan open source publishing platform, called \"my book online\".  I began writing seriously to share\nideas with others. \n\nThere was also a discussion in the book about how our thinking is colored by the generation that we\nare part of.  This led me into reading about the different generations currently in the US, and\nthe different ways of thinking that they have.\n\nThere is also a section that discusses the stages of learning specific skills.  This is useful when\nthinking about how teams of people work together.\n\nI cannot guarantee that you will have the same experience with this book that I did.  But I am\ncertain that if you read it you will think differently as a result.\n\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "How a book changed my life"}}, {"pk": 62, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/MyBook/Public/SeamansLog/UnfinishedBook", "time": "2014-06-15T20:36:08.332", "text": "* Embracing the Unfinished Book *                                              -*-muse-*-\n\nYou can use incompletion to drive progress.  Many people would like to write a book but are\noverwhelmed at the size of the task.  The may be preventing you from starting some great project.\nHere is an idea that may get you over that hump.\n\nThe are several problems with traditional writing. Each project is simply too big.  If the minimum\nbook size is 100 pages then you have nothing to use until you have invested several hundred hours.\nThis may work for the Victorian age but can not possibly keep up in the internet age.\n\nToday we live in a world of blogs, wikis, tweets, sound bites and a thimble size attention span.  No\none wants to read a giant book on anything.\n\nWe can decry the fall of civilization, or we can use this trend to our advantage.  In days gone by\nto be an author meant that you had to be the absolute expert on something.  Today, it simply means\nthat you have something interesting to say.\n\nConsider writing something short.  But make it useful.  If you can say the same thing in fewer words\nthen do it.  This is better for your readers.\n\nIt is also better for you.  Consider writing the main ideas for your book in a series of short\narticles.  Imagine 21 articles that outline your main topic.  I use a series of increasing levels of\ndetail (1 overview, 4 chapters, 16 discussions). If you write a single 300 article for each of these\nyou can be finished with your first pass in about fifty hours.\n\nAt this point you have written your first book. Assuming that you have something worthwhile to say\nthen readers can start enjoying your work right away.  Or you can wait for someday when you have\ntime to write a \"real\" book.\n\nNow comes the unfinished part.  You can easily double the size of each of the articles to 600 words\nfrom 300.

We can learn lessons from great companies about how to\ninvest our time.  By default, everything will be invested to get short-term results.  But this will\ncreate serious problems over the long run.\n\nIt is important to satisfy the immediate demand for results. But getting results quickly is not\nenough for sustained performance. Short-term gains must be backed up by long-term investments.\n\nGreat companies maximize potential over many years. In the early days of HP, the founders would\nencourage employees to work on projects that were completely outside of their regular\nresponsibilities.  Google is now famous for this same practice.\n\nWhat is true for companies is also true for every individual.  Thinking longer-term is thinking\nbigger. The most productive time spent, is the time spent thinking about what might be.  Learning\nnew skills and creating experimental projects is the way that you make yourself relevant in the\nworld of tomorrow.\n\nIn order to do this work, you need to build margin into your work life.  Without margin short-term\nthinking takes over. Constant demand for immediate results must be balanced by taking a longer\nview. If you are not spending about 20% of your time working outside of the immediate demands of\nyour job then you will soon be in trouble.  \n\nOne irony about working on the bigger picture, is that it makes you more productive in the\nshort-term as well.  Some of your ideas will have immediate application. What starts as a\nhair-brained idea, may end up becoming a tool or a new way of doing things that meets a need right\naway.\n\nI am not suggesting that you disappoint people that are counting on you, by working on things they\ndon't care about.  But you need to be building something that will last beyond this month. Create an\nagenda for projects that will help you learn a new skill.  Build a new tool, create a new process,\nor automate something that requires your time every day. \n\nMake a list of things that are worth your time. What do you dream about doing? What do you wish you\nknew? How can you give more to others? What will be the next big thing?  Plan out one special\nproject to complete each month.  Make is count.  Your future depends on it.\n\nI often hear people say that they are not allowed to work on anything that is beyond the immediate\ndemands of the project.  This may hold if your job is completely repetitive.  But if you are a\nknowledge worker of any kind, then you are paid to think.\n\nNo permission is needed for you to act professionally.  Focus on results for the long term.  Plan\nyour time so that you produce the most value over the next year.  Recognize that this is different\nthan creating the maximum benefit this week.\n\nUse good judgment to select the outcomes that will matter to your employers. But do not wait for\npermission or instruction about how you should build the future.\n\nUltimately, if you need to, pay for the investment yourself.  As a software consultant, for the last\n5 years, I have chosen to limit work for clients to four days a week.  This allows me the luxury of\nhaving a day each week that is devoted to learning new skills, building special projects, and doing\nwork for non-profit organizations.\n\nMost people can easily justify doing these projects as a part of their normal job expectations.  But\nif you need to, then it is worthwhile to invest your personal time.  Another benefit of this\napproach, is that you are completely decoupled from anyone's expectations for you.\n\nIf you make this investment, I assure you that you will never look back.  This will quickly become\nyour most enjoyable and productive work experience.\n", "user": 3, "title": "Invest 20% in your future"}}, {"pk": 65, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/MyBook/Public/SeamansLog/Creativity", "time": "2014-06-15T20:36:08.909", "text": "* Ideas that Change the World *                 -*-muse-*-\n\nYou can change the world by developing habits that make you more creative.  These habits are\nquite simple but often neglected.  As a result many people are stuck in dead-end jobs or living\nhumdrum lives of boredom.  You can start changing the world simply by changing your world first.\n\nHere are five practices that I have developed over the years to enhance creativity and amplify\neffectiveness.  Applying these in your life will produce similar results.\n\n1. **Focus on the pain**\n\nMost of us try so hard to tune out the pain in our lives that we don't understand that it is an\nindicator of where to change.  It is pointing you to the area where you can get the most benefit.\nAnalyze this pain and use it as motivation to make the needed changes.  Of course, this takes\ncourage! But it will result in the quickest personal improvements possible.\n\n2. **Make small changes constantly**\n\nForget the big steps.  They will take care of themselves if you make small steps.  If you want to\nloose 50 pounds, start by focusing on loosing one pound, or even not gaining a pound over\nChristmas.  Any big goal is completely out of reach, until you begin taking concrete steps toward\nit.  A quick win will get you energy you need to continue the change.  Find the smallest step that\nis in the right direction.\n\n3. **Spend time thinking**\n\nCreativity take energy.  The most creative people spend time brainstorming, evaluating ideas,\nanalyzing problems, and setting objectives.  If you think things through, then you will act less\nrashly.  You will have fewer failures and more success.  Thinking IS work.  Treat it as such, with\nall of the seriousness of other work activities.\n\n4. **Make a list and check it twice**\n\nConsider keeping a list of things that you need to think through.  When you have some \"think time\"\nthis is a great way to seed it.  What things are bugging you?  What conflicts are unresolved?  What\nis on your bucket list? What opportunities should you pursue next?  What things are you doing now\nthat you could stop?  These question are worth some serious time.\n\n5. **Read more and watch TV less**\n\nReading stimulates the mind, while TV numbs it.  Pick a couple of nights a week to read for pleasure\nor learning.  Budget time for both, since they are two different activities.\n\n6. **Let yourself dream again**\n\nEvery kid is a dreamer.  But most of us stop dreaming by about 25.  Allow yourself the indulgence of\npicturing your perfect life.  What latent dreams do you have?  What suppressed urges drive you?\nWrite them down.  This act alone may be enough to free you to think differently.  It will also give\nyou material to think through in more detail.\n\n7. **Act to learn**\n\nYou won't know what works until you take action.  Pick something that you want to change and develop\na hypothesis of how it works.  Now, develop an experiment that will let you understand more, while\nat the same time, making a small amount of progress.  The fastest way to learn is to take small\nactions that are specifically done to learn more.  In several steps we can make real progress\nquickly.  At each step you will have many more ideas to try, than weeks spent imagining possible\nsolutions.\n\n--- \n\nSend me email if you wish to unsubscribe to future messages.

At the beginning of\n2011 I set a goal to double my productivity within the year.  I measure productivity by the results\nthat I am able to produce for each hour of work invested.\n\nBy June I had already reached my goal.  That is a whopping 1000 hours saved each year!  I was\nastounded at these results and I want to share the lessons learned with you. You may not be able to\nachieve these exact results, but you should be able to save at least 500 hours within the next year.\n\nThe secret is in using a systematic approach to productivity.  Start by analyzing what you do in\nyour work and eliminate the biggest waste that you find.  There are four basic ways to eliminate\nwaste: stop doing things that are not needed, automate everything possible, use tools that minimize\nsteps, and reduce rework.\n\nMy results over the last year were primarily tied to the software tools that I am using.  These\ntools alone will save me around 1000 hours every year from now on.  A one-time investment in learning\nnew tools may also benefit you.  It really depends on your situation.\n\nMy most important tools saved me significant time over their competition.  I tried to estimate the\nbenefit of time saved by each of my top tools: \n Linux (400 hours saved/year),\n Emacs (250 hours saved/year), \n Git (200 hours saved/year), \n Python (150 hours saved/year),\n Gmail (100/y)\n\nThese savings do not come without investment.  Some tools require a lot of investment to gain the\nproductivity benefit. You need to understand the specific opportunities that you have before trying to\nselect tools that are right for you.\n\nSelect the tools that match your situation and spend any effort required to master them.  Expect and\ndemand a hundred-fold payoff for your time. This will pay off for you throughout your lifetime.  If\nyou are looking at learning a tool that may only be useful for a couple of years then limit your\ninvestment.  \n\nOn the other hand, tools that have already been popular for 10 or 20 years are likely to be around\nfor another 20.  These tools have already proven their worth to many others.  Select these and\ninvest any amount of learning required to use them well.  These will be the tools that you will be\nusing five years from now.\n", "user": 3, "title": "Better tools save time"}}, {"pk": 67, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/MyBook/Public/SeamansLog/Search", "time": "2014-06-15T20:36:09.288", "text": "* Search and Seizure *                 -*-muse-*-\n\nYour ability to learn is far more important to you than your current knowledge.  In the past it was\npossible to know everything required to make you successful.  But this is no longer true. Today it\nis impossible to know everything within your own field.\n\nThe internet has produced an explosion of data for every area of our lives.  The problem that we\nsuffer from, is not a lack of information, but information overload.  We can easily lose the ability\nto make sense of the information we are exposed to.\n\nWe often see learning as absorbing a body of knowledge and applying it to everyday problems.  But\nnow, the body of knowledge is so vast you could not learn it in 100 lifetimes. The only workable\nanswer is to be more selective about what you need to know.\n\nDecide what is most important and concentrate on that.  This applies to your leisure reading as well\nas learning for your job.  All material that you consume must be either amusing or useful.\nRuthlessly eliminate low value sources, in favor of ones that give you what you really need.\n\nList the categories of your primary interests, both personal and professional.  Select the top two\nresources in each of these areas.  Forget the rest.  Follow the highly informative and interesting\nsources of great quality input.  Life is too short to wade through boring and irrelevant info.\n\nStop trying to remember things that you can look up.  Become an expert in using Google searches to\nanswer questions in less than a minute.  Try this...  Find out what the escape-velocity from the\nmoon is, or the sunset tomorrow.  Time how many seconds it takes you to find the answer. Why\nremember such things when they can easily be discovered so quickly?\n\nBecome an expert in finding things rapidly when needed.  This will give you more mental energy to\nfocus on the \"Why\" questions.  Stored knowledge is mostly about the \"What\" questions.  Spend time\nthinking about the types of information that you really need, and how you can make\nbetter decisions.  Figure out to apply the knowledge that you have to simplify your life.\n\nFocus on integrating knowledge rather than acquiring it.  Examine your life for areas of ongoing\nfrustration and put your problem-solving skills to work. Shift your focus from gathering and storing\nknowledge to making needed improvements.

State what you want to write about.  This will\nhelp you stay on your topic.  Identify the bulls-eye of what you think your primary message\nis about.\n\nBe willing to go beyond this primary topic, but somehow tie your discussion back into it.  Don't\nforce yourself to only write about main subject, since this might lead to repetition.\n\nI recommend writing on a regular schedule.  Select either weekly or monthly.  Any less frequently,\nand your blog will become an abandoned source of shame to you.  No one needs another \"to-do\" that\nyou \"to-didn't\".\n\nWho is your reader?  This is an important question.

I also hope that real people in this universe are\nfacinated by the same subjects.\n\nI think it is better to start by selecting a subject that you feel passion about, than targeting a\nspecific audience.  Ultimately, your readers will end up people who are interested in what you have\nto say.  The more passion you have, the more interesting your writing will be.\n\nApproach writing as a journey.  Each time you write it will be a little better.  Don't expect to be\na master at the beginning.  Occasionally go back and rework past article with a new viewpoint.  This\nwill reveal how much your skill has grown in the elapsed time period.\n\nWriting can be very satisfying.

Our work succcess is directly tied\nto the expectations of others.  Choosing and communicating our commitments  are skills that we must\nmaster in order to be successful.\n\nThis starts by truly understanding the constraints we face.  We need to accept reality and build\nupon it.  At the same time we should challenge current boundaries and explore alternatives. It may\nhelp for you to write down the constraints that can't be changed.\n\nDo not be swept along with the tide.  Instead make decisions about the things you are committed to.\nGather all of the relevant data and evaluate alternatives. When you have done this you can\nconfidently commit to action.  Now you can communicate your decision to others with clarity.\n        \nSetting the expectations is a core part of making commitments.  Demonstrate an understanding of the\nbusiness needs that are at stake. Show what you can do, and what you cannot. Highlight any risks\nthat you might see.\n\nOnce you have made a commitment, communicate progress regularly.  This will give people confidence\nthat the desired results will be achieved.  Reiterate the overall plan and show how the progress is\nbeing made. Communicate current risks quickly.  Don't save them for a nasty surprise later. Discuss\nany adjustments needed early.\n\nPeople that excell at making effective commitments will be successful.  There will be less conflict\nand more alignment with those who count on you.  This is a core competency that will be useful in\nevery area of your life.\n", "user": 3, "title": "Make Effective Commitments"}}, {"pk": 71, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/MyBook/Public/SeamansLog/HabitualChange", "time": "2014-06-15T20:36:09.951", "text": "* Habitual Change *                 -*-muse-*-\n\nImprovement is a lifestyle choice\n\nThe best way to develop constructive habits is to plan for the changes that matter to you the\nmost. Don't settle for the status quo. But don't let someone else dictate what those changes should\nbe. You probably know yourself better than your spouse, boss, or co-workers do.\n\nDecide on the changes you would like to see first.  Then figure out what habit would move you a\nlittle closer to that goal.  The key to making changes is adopting new habits.\n\nA habit is caused when you behave the same way so many times that it becomes an automatic response.\nAt that point it no longer requires effort.  Unfortunately it takes about 30-40 repetitions of\nconscious effort to create the habit.  That is what make habit forming so difficult.\n\nTry to work on one new habit at a time.  Because it takes effort you will be be much more successful\nif you take one change at a time.  This means that you can realistically develop twelve new habits a\nyear.  You might tie them to months and plan ahead for future changes.\n\nAnother way to increase your success is to make the change as small as possible.  Remember that\nmaking a series of small changes will lead to a huge change.  What is the smallest change that you\ncould be satisfied with?  What habit will get you to that change?\n\nGo for changes that you are willing to commit to for the rest of your life.  Forget severe changes\nthat will create a rebound affect in your will power.  Make micro-change, but hold every step\ngained.  Don't allow yourself to ever drop a new habit unless you decide that it was a mistake in\nthe first place.  Hesitate to commit yourself to any new habit until you are totally sure about it.\n\nConsider adopting the 5,10,30,60 pattern.  If your true goal is to do something an hour a day, don't\nstart there.  Limit your initial goal to 5 minutes a day.  From 0 to 5 is huge!  It will take you a\nmonth to create an automatic response, just for that.  Then you can extent the impact of the\nactivity without having to relearn the basic behavior pattern of doing it.\n\nBy starting with a commitment that is too high you are refusing to acknowledge the barriers that have\nprevented you from making the change already.  Move slower, but always move forward.  Take four\nmonths to get to the desired level.  But remember, you will use this habit for the rest of your\nlife.\n\nCreating change itself can be habit forming.\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Habitual Change"}}, {"pk": 72, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/MyBook/Public/SeamansLog/ActToLearn", "time": "2014-06-15T20:36:10.125", "text": "* Act To Learn *                 -*-muse-*-\n\nI just read a terrific book.  It is called \"Action Trumps Everything\".\nIt is about creating what you want in an uncertain world.  What do you\ndo when the future is inherently unknowable and unpredictable?  Most\nof the tools that we have are for projecting past experience into the\nfuture.\n\nThe big idea of the book is that if you cannot know the future you can\ntake small steps and learn.  Each action creates learning which in\nturn defines the next action.  Instead of creating a map of the entire\njourney to your destination consider moving one step closer.\n\nJust moving toward your goal will make you aware of things that you\ncould not possibly have forseen.  No amount of thinking about your\ngoal will be better than a real experiment. \n\nIf your action is done to learn then no outcome is a bad outcome.  If\nyou are hoping to start a business but you find out that there are not\nenough customers, then that is a very positive outcome.  The most\nimportant goal of each experiment is to learn.\n\nBe willing to fully follow up on everything that you learn.  \n    1. Adapt to the new realities that you find by changing strategy.\n    2. Learn what next steps have the biggest opportunity.\n    3. Adjust your goals by what you learn.\n\nControl your investment on each step.  Make sure that you understand\nwhat you can afford to lose, and what you are willing to lose.  These\nare often two different things.\n\nAct quickly.  In order to make progress it is important to keep the\nsteps small.  Try to reduce the size of your steps to maximize\neffectiveness.  Identify things that you could do this month or this\nweek.  Even better, pick something that you could do today.\n\nIn situations where you cannot predict the future, it is best to\ncreate it.  Actions will allow you to shape the future that you most\ndesire.

But what does it mean to really\nthrive?  It is best if we take the most holistic definition possible. Thriving means to be\nsuccessful, content, and happy.\n\nIn order for this to happen there are a number of different aspects of our life that need to be\ncultivated. Let's focus on the five most important areas.\n\n * Personal well-being \n * Relationships\n * Knowledge\n * Actions\n * Problem-solving\n\nPersonal well-being is essential to growth in any other area.  If you are suffering physically,\nemotionally, or financially then there is no room in your life for other areas of growth.  All\ndevelopment takes energy and you need margin in order to begin.  Once you start then you can draw\nstrength and encouragement from making progress. Before you focus in other areas, do an honest review\nof you personal well-being.  It is the foundation that you need to build upon.\n\nYou can not be truly happy unless your relationships are thriving.  In a Facebook world the term\nfriend has all but lost its meaning.  Rediscover the true meaning of friendship. Cultivate your\nthree closest friends. Share more and take greater risks with them.  At the same time, consider\nways that you can extend your more casual relationships and maybe go a little deeper with them.\nConsciously avoid the irritating people in your life as much as possible.\n\nKnowledge is an important asset.  It is something that you totally control.  But be intentional about\nwhat you learn.  Figure out what is most critical for you to know and completely master it.  I\nbelieve that you stop learning when you die (and vice-versa).  Knowledge is one key that will open\ndoors for you in your career.  Manage it, don't coast.\n\nTake Action. Every day you have opportunities to do things. Make the most of these by carefully\ndeciding what you will work on and what you will stop doing. Schedule your leisure activities as\nwell so that you can get the most from your playtime.  Focus on what to do today and put everything\nelse on another list.  It is amazing what happens when you limit your time horizon to the very near\nfuture.\n\nBecome a problem-solver.  Figure out what is not working and fix it.  Treat everything in life as a\npuzzle that has a better solution.  You can make small optimizations to your life every day.  Each of\nthe small changes adds up into an enormous impact over time.\n\nSpend a few minutes for a personal review.  Rank yourself in each of these five areas.  In your\nstrongest area, how can you go even further?  What is one step you could take to develop your\nweakest area?\n\n--- \n\nReply to this message if you wish to eliminate future email messages.

to enable you to go from no previous knowledge of Django\nto building a web application using Django.  \n\nIn addition to getting an overview of Django, I'm going to dive into some detail on the\n50 Tricks that are essential to building an application.  Building a web\napplication, or any other program for that matter, is really a matter of understanding\nthe specific tricks that you need to do to get your technical work done and then\nassembling those tricks based on the needs of your application.  \n\nPresentationGoals\n\nBy the end of this book you will know how to create a running web application using the 50 Tricks.  The 50 Tricks are a catalogue of best practices that will provide you with one interesting way to solve a particular problem - rather than present all the possible ways that you might solve that particular problem.  \n\nWhatsDjango\n\nSo let's start by talking about Django.  Django is a framework that is very\nsimilar to ASP.net or Rails or JSP and it's based on a language in the same way that\nC-sharp is used to write ASP.net applications or Ruby is used to write Rail\napplications.  So Python is to Django like Ruby is to Rails.  Building a web\napplication requires both a great computer language and a framework that solves\na lot of the recurring problems for you.  When you select a programming language, you also need to select a framework. \n\nWhyDjango\n\nThere are many different frameworks written in Python. I selected Django after evaluating a number of other frameworks such as Pyramid, for example.  Django offers a great set of features and it's also interesting that Django was created by factoring real world applications.  A number of different applications were created and then the commonality, the common\nelements of those applications, were re-factored into a library that could be used on future applications.  \n\nSome frameworks are created by analyzing a problem in the abstract and then developing a framework, Django was developed by capturing real world applications in specific elements that were reusable within that. This avoids the Ivory Tower design problem and ensures that everything in the library is there for a reason. When you re-factor real applications; you end\nup with a minimalistic framework, rather than a conglomeration of everything that someone could think to include - everything is there because it has an immediate use in an actual\nsituation.  \n\nAnother thing that attracted me to Django is the docs are probably better than any other technical documentation I've read.  There are a number of different hosting options available.  I recommend the kind of hosting where you pay about 10 bucks a month and get a shared virtual server that can be set up in about an hour.  The result is, with the investment of about an hour's worth of time and 10 bucks a month, you can host your application. I set up new hosting for each new Django app I develop because the hosting is virtually free, compared to the development time.\n\nThe other thing that's really nice about Django is it's really great for automation.\nYou can expose all of the functionality of your running application, your running\nGUI.  You can expose that either as a web service or as a set of scripts that you\ncan use with command line operations to do the same thing.  I find that this is\nreally, really useful for doing automated testing and there's a lot of automated testing capabilities built into the framework itself.  \n\nLearnByDoing\n\nI believe in learning by doing.  The fastest way to learn something is to pick a project and pick a technology - dive in and figure out what problems you need to solve along the way rather than trying to learn a lot about the technology before you start working on a project.  This is a similar approach to the refactoring of applications into a framework, creating a INSERTlearning a technology like creating an application is the fastest way to go.  The project we'll use as an example for this book is a wiki.\n\n\nFiftyTricks\n\nLet's talk about 50 Tricks.  There are two types of knowledge: there is a broad base\nof engineering knowledge which involves things like how to define a software project,\nhow to design the actual writing of the code, the debugging and testing of that code.\nThat's a general body of knowledge that is very transportable from project to project\nand from technology to technology.  \n\nThe other type of knowledge that engineers have that is valuable is a specific\ntechnology that translates into a catalogue of how to solve specific\nproblems.  I'm calling these tricks because, once you know a specific trick, you can\napply that trick in about an hour.  But to learn a new trick, takes about a day's\nworth of experimentation and messing around.  And I'm hoping that this presentation\nwill short-circuit that activity for you so that you can see one successful way to do\neach trick and then, when you're working on your pile of project, you can basically\njust draw from my catalogue of tricks and then maybe in a couple of hours, have a\nworking knowledge of how to apply that trick, rather than a whole day.  \n\nThis idea of tricks is what explains the difference between people that are very\neffective at using a technology and people that are just learning that technology.  If\nyou switch technologies, you basically flush your bag of tricks and have to restock it\nwith that new technology.  So if you're a really good Ruby programmer and you are\ngoing to Python for the first time, for example, you will have to restock your tricks,\nrelearn the -- even though you may know a lot of the Ruby tricks for doing all of\nthese things that we're going to present, you will have to go back and relearn each of\nthe tricks for the technology that you're trying to do. \n\nSo if we compare two programmers, one that is very fluent in a technology and one that\nis not fluent and the average application requires about 50 tricks, this whole project\ncan be completed in about 50 hours.  If a person is at the same time they're\ndeveloping the application, they are learning the tricks, then that same project will\ntake that person about 50 days.  And so this accounts for the order of magnitude\ndifference in program productivity.  It's not how smart the people are, but how\nfamiliar they are with this specific technology and the tricks that are part of that\ntechnology.\n\nTrickGroups\n\nSo we're going to be looking at seven groups of tricks in our application development.\nThe first set of tricks that we're going to be looking at is how to set up a server.\nThe next set of tricks is about working with data inside your application.  And then\nwe're going to work with views and we're going to work with formatting, getting the\nstyle that you want.  Then we're going to be working with documents in the file system\nand in the database and then we are going to look at user authentication and\nauthorization.  And then we are going to kind of step back and take a look at some\nproject-related tricks, as well.  \n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\n**Server  (5 Tricks)**\n\nServerStart\n\nOkay, we're ready to start our first set of tricks.  So what we want to do is we want\nto set up a Django server that can serve our project needs.  So the first that we need\nto be able to do is we need to be able to run the server application.  So Django ships\nwith a lightweight server that can be used instead of Apache.  When you go to\nproduction, you're definitely going to want to deploy your application on an\nindustrial server, like Apache, but for development purposes, you can spin up with one\nline of code, you can spin up a server and you can test out all your things and be\nable to work with your application.  \n\nSo here what I've done is I've shown you how to get that server running.  There is a\nmanaged script and you just use the script inside of that, called Runserver and now\nall of a sudden, you have your application listening to whatever port you told it to\nlisten to and serving your pages.\n\nWhen you go to production, you're likely to want to deploy that on Apache.  There are\na number of other options that you can use as well, but I deploy most of my Django\napplications on Apache.  And so here's an example of restarting the server remotely\nfrom a development machine.  So all you really need to do is you need to SSH into a\nparticular machine name and then you need to find the restart script in Apache and\njust run it.  And so that one line of code will net you a remote server.  \n\nOkay, the next thing that we want to do now that we're running our server is we want\nto load a web page and check it out.  And so when we're running our development\nserver, it normally starts up on port 8000.  So if you just point Firefox to\nlocalhost:8000 that will load your pages.  That's the first trick, starting the\nserver.  \n\nCreateProject\n\nThe second trick that we want to do is we want to create a new project.  So we're\nready to start our thing, we're ready to start writing code.  There's a set of scripts\nthat are bundled under the Django admin script.  And so if you just type Django admin\nstart project Mystore then it will create a new project for you called Mystore.  And\nwhat you see here in that directory is a number of different files that Django will\ncreate for you, including the glue logic that runs in the web server that allows you\nto answer HTTP requests.  So all that infrastructure is created for you and all you\nneed to do is modify a few basic settings to add your application logic. \n\nHelloWorld\n\nAnd so the next that we do is we see the end of the directory and we run the server\nand then we load the web page.  So now you should have a running web application.  \n\nThe next that we want to do, our application, it runs, but it doesn't do anything and,\nat the very minimum, we want to answer and HTTP request.  And so this is just about\nthe simplest application that you can write.  So here what we do is there is a URLs\nfile that is automatically created for us.  And what we are going to do is we are\ngoing to hook in to that URLs file and give it regular expression that matches the\nHTTP request that is going to be made.  And then we're going to generate a HTTP\nresponse for that.  So we could do all of this in about three lines of code. \n\nInterviewer:\tSo is each one of these slides one trick?  So the one earlier where you\nhad three different blue headers or is that just one trick between the three of them?\n\nRespondent:\tThat's one trick, starting the server and then creating a project, one trick.\nOne trick saying hello world.  \n\n\nOkay, so this code snippet here, if you were to just cut and paste this in or type it\ninto your editor then you test it out, fire it up and within five minutes after you've\nstarted the project, you can at least answer HTTP [inaudible 16:12].  And all you've\nwritten here now is really -- you've executed a couple of shell scripts, but you've\nonly written about four or five lines of Python maybe in total. \n\nCreateApp\n\nIn reality, you don't actually create applications by just hard coding the URLs with\nthe patterns to find.  What you really do is you really create a cluster of\nfunctionality that Django calls an application.  I don't like this particular name\nbecause it feels more like a module to me than an application, but nevertheless that's\nthe vocabulary that Django uses.\n\nAnd so what you're really going to want to do is you're going to want to create what\nDjango calls an app and you're going to give it a name.  So in our example here, we're\ngoing to create an app called Buymore.  And so what we do is we use that managed\nscript again, which really just sets the context for executing Python stuff.  So we do\nstart app Buymore and it creates a whole directory structure for us.  It creates model\ncode, it creates views and it creates kind of a skeleton that we can work with and we\ncan add our application logic.  \n\nHomeView\n\nThe other thing that you need to do is, you need to hook that application in using\nyour settings file that it created for you.  You need to reference your Buymore\napplication as an installed application.  And that will mean that Django will go and\nlook for your model code and your view code and your URLs and all that stuff.  It\nknows that that's an integral part of your application that you're building.  So one\nline of code will basically hook up your application into the settings.  \n\nSo now what we've done is we've created a new app called Buymore inside of our Django\napplication.  Now the next trick that we're going to do is we're actually going to\nwrite a view code that will respond to our HTTP request.  And here what we are doing\nis we're going to handle the URL that is blank so you just hit -- if you just type in\nthe top level website domain then this is the URL that you're going to get and you're\ngoing to get the homepage.  And so in this case, we've created an application that has\nexactly one page that it can respond to.  And we've hard coded an HTTP response that\njust replies Mystore contents for that request.  \n\nInterviewer:\tSo URLs maps things to function [codes]?\n\nRespondent:\tYes, it's a regular expression that it parses the regular expression if it --\nit's a stack of regular expressions typically.  And, as soon as it finds the first one\nthat matches then it binds to your Python code that is located in the Buymore application\nin the views file and then inside of views is a function defined as homepage.  And then we\njust have a hard coded response.\n\nInterviewer:\tSo if you wanted to have a custom 404 not found page, would you just put\n[inaudible 19:59] pattern at the very bottom of your stack?\n\nRespondent:\tYes.\n\nInterviewer:\tSo everything else doesn't match you can send it to the...\n\nRespondent:\tAnd so you can do really fancy handling of 404s and all that kind of stuff.\nAnd then in these responses, you can also redirect.  So when you're -- instead of just\nhard coding a HTTP response, you might want to redirect to some other page if you\ndetermine that a certain situation is needed. \n\nSo now we've been able to create a server, create a project, create an application and\nthen create handlers within that application.  Now what we're going to do is we're\ngoing to figure out how to work with data.  So we haven't worked with any data at all.\nWe had just hard coded everything.  \n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\n**Data (9 Tricks)**\nDataBase\nDataBasePostGres\nNewDataModel\nCreateDatabase\nAddRecord\nSaveRecord\nQueryRecords\nShowResults\nDeleteRecord\n\nThe first thing that you will want to do in your application is you're going to want\nto hook to a database.  And in addition to Django shipping with a lightweight server,\nthey also allow you to hook up to a lightweight database.  And so when you're just\nmessing around when you're creating your application, you can create a database in a\nsingle file and then when you're all done then you can basically deploy that and\nreroute that to a more industrial database.  \n\nSo in this case, what we're going to do is we're going to just hook the sequel\n[inaudible 21:34].  And the only that we need to do with [inaudible 21:38] because it\ndoesn't use any user authentication or anything like that, it's just a vocal file on\nyour file system.  The only thing that we need to do is just name the file.  And so\nwe're going to call this thing Hammer DB.\n\nNow later on, you decide that you really need to use postscripts for example, or\nMysequel or any other kind of database that you fancy.  And so here what we do is we\nhave to name the database and then we have to have database access credentials.  And\nso all we do is just change the name of the connection string that we're going to use\nto mount that database.  \n\nAnd typically on web host environments, the database is not located on the same server\nor often times it's not located on the same server that your web application runs on.\nAnd so, no problem; just put the access credentials for the other server.  So we\nchanged three lines of code and all of a sudden we were able to go from a single file\ndatabase to an industrial database.  \n\nOkay, the next thing that we want to do is we want to define our own data types.  And\nthen we want to take these data types and put them in the database as table types.\nAnd so here what we are going to do is we're going to define a class called Note and\nit's going to have two fields.  It's going to have a title and a body and one is going\nto be a fixed [length string] that can go up to a maximum size of 200 and the body is\njust going to be some indeterminate length of text.  And that's all we have to do.\nThree lines of code and now we have a model that we can use.  You put this model into\nthe model's file in your app so in like the Buymore app, if we put the note in there\nthen it's good to go.  \n\nInterviewer:\tDoes it matter what app your data type is declared under since there's\nmultiple models that.\n\nRespondent:\tIt creates tables that contain both the app name and the model name within\nthat and so if you have customers as an app and, if you have orders as a model within that\nthen the table that is created is called customers underscore order.  \n\nNow we're ready to take that model code and generate a database for us.  So you don't\nactually have to write sequel to create the database formats.  All you really have to\ndo is to find the Python code that accesses the data type and then it controls the\ndatabase for you.  So it will actually generate the database.  And the way you do that\nis to do manage by [sync DB] and then that will create all of the missing data tables\nfor you.  \n\nThis is really awesome because, if you're creating data types all the time, they just\nkeep syncing the database and it creates a bunch of stuff for you.  Once you put data\nin the table, it will not modify the database.  You'll have to do that manually.  And\nthere are some tools to help you with that, but the common case is that you're just\ngoing to create a bunch of data.  I typically recreate the database many, many times\nthroughout projects and I will tend to throw it away.\n\nInterviewer:\tOur experience was that we had to create some migration scripts [in order\nto diminish that pie] for when we change the data type of fields instead of the database.\n\nRespondent:\tCorrect.  There's a couple of other great tools that will allow you to\nside-step sequel.  You can dump all of the data in your database as JSON and then you can\nload it back in and so this is a great thing to do if you just want to mess with the data\nor you just want to write transforms that mess with the data and then put it all back in.  \n\nIt's also a great tool that you can use to actually do queries in a form that maybe\nyou want to send out to a front-end client app and you just want to have a job script\non the front-end that manipulates your data.  What you might want to do is just dump a\nbig [hairy] piece of data right out of your database and then just [hype it] to the\ncustomer or to the front-end app that can manipulate.  \n\nThe next thing we want to do is we want to add a record of a particular type.  So this\nis our old friend, the [Note].  It has a title and a body and to add a record, all you\nneed to do is create a blank object just by calling the initializer for a note, set\nthe fields that you want and then save it.  The save is really smart about how to get\nthe data in the right place and whether you have an exception to the data if you're\nmissing a field or something like that.  And then there are also some additional\nvalidation things.  Save will throw an exception and you might want to handle that\nexception if you're not sure if it's valid or not.  But really nice, one line of code\nbasically just smashes your data in the database.\n\nInterviewer:\tWe were using Get or Create, but this is a lot simpler.\n\nRespondent:\tThe next thing you want to do is you may want to modify an object.  So again,\nhere's our friend the Note.  We just get a note and we reset its body and save it.  So\nthat allows you to modify things that already exist in the database or selectively modify\nfields allows you to -- so really to get here is doing a select and then the save is doing\nan update underneath.  But you don't need to worry about that.  You don't need to worry\nabout whether you have one or don't have one or whatever.  This simple pattern here is\ngreat for saving your data. \n\nInterviewer:\tSo will that give you a new blank object with title equals title?\n\nRespondent:\tNo, it will throw an exception and so there is a version of the [getter] that\nwill\n\nOkay, so the next thing that we want to do is we want to go out and list how many\nobjects match a particular thing.  So the first thing we want to do is just enumerate\nall of the objects in the system of particular types.  So we ask for notes -- we ask\nfor note, objects all and this returns a list of all of the matching notes.  \n\nThe next thing we might want to do is we might want to match a particular title when\nwe're looking for something in the database and so, again, this generates a select\nstatement where the title matches the word lost worlds.  And the last case that we\nmight want to do is something more complicated where we're looking for a string in the\ntitle that is greater than some value or it could be a numeric thing.  \n\nAnd Django gives us a really nice list of modifiers that can be used for matching\ncertain kinds of criteria.  So there's greater than, less than, not equal and you can\ndo things like count how many there are and, if the count is bigger than a number, you\ncan do all kinds of things.  So anyway, the sky is the limit.  There's about 34\ndifferent types of modifiers that you can use.  And you can do date ranges and all\nkinds of things.  There's no reason to write sequel.  If you're a sequel-hater like me\nthen Django gives you all the tools that will let you sidestep that.  \n\nThe next thing that you might want to do is you might want to [iterate] through --\nyou've got this query, you get back a bunch of things and now what you want to do is\nyou want to walk the list and print out all the title of the books or all the titles\nof the notes or whatever it is that your database is holding.  \n\nAnd so here's an example of printing out all the notes and it just prints a model, one\nline each as a title and text and it just gives you a nice table of notes.  And so you\ncould imagine wrapping these kinds of things in text tools to do [inaudible 31:57] and\nbasically manage all of your stuff with automated [inaudible].  This kind of stuff is\njust extremely handy for that.  \n\nA more interesting example is you might want to query the database and give back a\ntable of notes and then apply formatting to that because you might want to have your\nweb page, for example, create a table for you.  And what you need is you need a\ntwo-dimensional list of items that then you want to populate in a table.  What this\nallows you to do is a set of generic views, like a table pager that knows nothing\nabout the data that it's holding, but it controls all of the formatting stuff.  \n\nAnd then underneath you have a query function that can generate a table out of the\ncontents that you want to look up, but you don't have any idea how you want to format\nthis.  So this is what we call in the software industry, separation of concerns.  So\nthe formatting of the table is completely independent of the populating of the data in\nthe table.  So here's an example of getting a table out of a database.  One line a\ncode, really nice\n\nThe next thing you might want to do to close out our set of [inaudible 33:38]\noperations is you might want to delete a record.  And so here I've given three\nexamples deleting everything in the database or deleting things that match a specific\ncriteria or a more complicated set of matches and these are essentially the matches\nthat we had before.  So once you've learned these set of operations of how to query\nand how to select certain things then everything that you expect scales out and you\ncan apply any operations.  And here all we're doing is just calling the delete\n[member] function on the \n\nInterviewer:\tSo will this delete underscore note just delete the first entry [inaudible\n34:24].\n\nRespondent:\t[inaudible].  Yes, get only returns one.  Filter returns many.  And that's why\nwe have to iterate the filter list.  This one will actually blow up or throw an exception\nif there is no matching -- the get operation will throw an exception if there is no\nmatching object.\n\nInterviewer:\tBut if there's more than one note with lost worlds as the title it will it\nonly delete the first one? \n\nRespondent:\tGet will have problems with that and so you would use a variant of filter if\nyou thought that there were multiple ones.\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\n**Views (7 Tricks)**\nHomeView\nListViewUrl\nListView\nDetailsView\nFormModel\nAddRecordView\nEditView\nDeleteView\n\nSo now we have the ability to create an application.  We have the ability to\nmanipulate data within that application.  The next set of tricks that we're going to\nexplore is how to build views in our system because after all, we want to build a\nweb-based system and one of the key parts of that is building our views.  \n\nNow these views can be HTML-generated or they could be maybe XML or JSON in the formal\nweb service thing.  I build a lot of web services where you basically can query URLs\nand then have the rendering not be intended for human view, but is just a blob of JSON\ndata that you might want to put on your cell phone or do something like that.  So this\nworks both for front-end services as well as back-end services.  \n\nSo the next that we're going to do is we're going to revisit our friend the home view\nand here what we're doing is we're matching the regular expression that is the\n[inaudible 36:26] string, the beginning and end of line together.  The URL parser has\nthis regular expression language.  It's kind of some nasty syntax, but once you spend\nmaybe an hour trying to figure out how it works, it's not that hard, but when you're\nreading it for the first time, it's kind of offensive, but you'll get used to it.  \n\nSo here we have our old friend the view that we just hard coded to return my store\ncontents.  The next thing that we're going to want to do is we're going to want to\nhave a list of items that we are going to want to display.  And so here we're parsing\nout in addition to the home page, we're parsing out the list URL and mapping that to\nthe Python function list page.  \n\nHere's the implementation of the list page thing.  And this is very typical of the\nkind of thing that you will see is that the function it calls some Python function,\nwhich generates a list of items and then it puts that in a variable called products\nand then it loads a template and the template is a bunch of HTML code that's augmented\nwith some Pythony-stuff, so that I can manipulate the data inside my Python views.  \n\nSo our template here is going to iterate over each of the things in the products list.\nIt's going to call each one P and then it is going to print the label of P both as the\nHREF of the anchor as well as the text that gets displayed to a user.  So what you end\nup with after this runs is a bullet list of all of the products that are linked to the\nindividual pages for those products.  \n\nOkay, the next thing that we want to do is we want to create a details view.  So we\nhave a list of hyperlinks that link to each of the pages for each of our products and\nnow what we want to do is we want to pick of each of the individual products.  And so\nhere we see a more complex syntax for parsing off the argument that's the product ID\nthat we want to display. \n\nAnd so that will be passed into the view, which is called item.  So we have a function\ncalled item and it takes a request and an ID.  And that ID is the variable that got\nparsed off in the URL pattern.  So presumably it's -- and, in fact, it says that it's\na series of digits.  So you're going to say URL with a domain name slash 33 and that's\ngoing to map to an item call in the views [code].  \n\nThen the template that is being used to display this details view is called details\ndot HTML.  And so, in this case, we are passing the ID of the product, which is a --\nI'm rewording this.  Just a minute. \n\nHere what we do is we look up the specific product object out of the database and then\nwe pass that object into the template and then, inside the template, we crack it open\nand we print its primary key, its title, its description or when there were other\nfields it has.  And so this is typical of Django views that there's typically a very\nsmall amount of code that deals with the object types that are being used.  But you\ncan imbed some Python code in the template itself to handle special cases. \n\nOkay, the next thing that we want to do, and I have to say that this is probably the\nmost complicated thing that I'm going to show.  And this is form editing.  And so here\nwhat we're going to do is we're going to pass back data to our view from user input\nand there's several parts to this.  The first part is that we define a form that knows\nwhat edit fields and things like that, that knows what UI to put on our template so\nthat we don't have to write the code that enumerates all of the contents of the class\nthat we want to edit. \n\nSo instead what we do is we define a note form and that note form references the\nactual object type and so it knows that it needs to create a text field for that first\n-- or it needs to create an input field for that first path field in the object type.\nAnd then for the body, it needs to create a text area to match the data type.  And so\nwhat happens is a form comes up on the user interface just that is consistent with the\n-- that is consistent with the object type and we didn't have to define any of the UI\nelements for our specific data type.  All we had to do was create a form that\nreferences the underlying data type. \n\nOkay, in the template part of this, we use this called Form S Table and that is the\nthing that figures out what UI elements need to be present to edit that particular\nkind of a thing.  And the other nasty piece is this cross-site reference and it is --\nI'm going to ignore that for now, but you have to have this to prevent somebody from\ninvoking your form from another website.  This verifies that the creator of this form\nis a legitimate service.\n\nOkay, so we've created the surface area of our form.  Now what we're going to do is\nwe're going to populate this form with data and then we're going to accept that data\nback after the user has typed in the title and body of their note.  And so here what\nyou see is a typical construct where we're using a post-back and there are three cases\nthat we need to handle in our forms.\n\nThe first case is that we have a blank form that we want to present to the user.  And\nso we're adding an element, we're adding a data type to our database and so we put up\na blank form.  The second case is that we have a post-back and the data is good.  And\nthen the third case is that we have a post-back and the data is not good.  It will not\nvalidate and so we can't put it into the database.  And if you analyze this piece of\ncode here, it handles all three of those cases.  In the case where we have valid data\nthen we redirect to the home page and so you could put any redirects in there.  \n\nOkay, now this is the super complicated case because now we have data that we're going\nto put in the form with, by looking up an object in the database.  So they're trying\nto edit note number 33 and so we actually can look up note number 33, put the data\ninto the note then give it back to the user.\n\nInterviewer:\tAs an editable form. \n\nRespondent:\tAs an editable form.  Then when they edit that, then we have the other two\ncases for the post-back that we either have valid or invalid data.  And so this particular\nform handles all of those paths.  \n\nOkay, glad we're through that.  Now for more easy stuff.  We're going to delete based\non accessing a URL.  So here what we need to do is we need to figure out exactly what\nitem we're trying to delete from the database and then just map that to a delete view.\nInside the delete view, what we do is we look up the particular object in the database\nand then we just call its delete function if we found it.  If we didn't find it, we\nprobably don't want to blow up the program. \n\nAnd then, in either case, we're going to redirect to the home view because we just\ndeleted something out of the table.  This could be -- this is typically a list of\nitems and you're going to delete them out of a table of a list and so that's usually\nwhat the code looks like.  And then this, in our list view, I've given a snippet of an\nanchor that will get you that URL.  And so this is an example of how you might put\nthat into your table. \n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\n**Formatting (4 Tricks)**\nPageLayout\nPageTemplate\nStandardNavigation\nJsSupport\n\nOkay, now we're through views.  So we've created our application, we've manipulated\ndata, we've built a set of views.  And so those are all operations that you need to be\nable to work with data in a typical website.  Now what we're going to do is we're\ngoing to style our website.  \n\nOne really nice thing that Django provides is the ability to declare a template that\ncan be used by other templates to set your page styling so you can control the styling\nof your entire website from modifying your single base template.  So in this case,\nI've created a template called layout, not HTML and there's a couple of things that\nyou would typically want to do.  One is I like to use Twitter Bootstrap in all my\nprojects and this gives the site an instant styling without putting any effort into\nit.  And so here, what I've done is I've just imbedded the libraries, the library\nreferences to Twitter Bootstrap right here on my base page and then all the other\npages get it for free.  \n\nThe other thing that you typically do is you have some area of content that you want\neach page to override.  And so Django gives you the ability to define blocks and then\na default handling of those blocks.  So if in the inside of this block here, this\nblock content, I provided a bunch of HTML and then the page that extends this layout,\nif it doesn't redefine that HTML, if it doesn't provide its own version of that block\nthen you get the default.  So that's kind of nice for having some default behavior\nlike no content goes here or something like that.  It's a handy way to do that.  \n\nOkay and then this is a trick where we're going to extend that template and utilize\nthat in the context of our project.  And so here what we've done is we've defined a\nblock content, which has a title on each one and then it has an unordered list of\nitems for a number of different directories or a number of different files.  So this\nis basically -- this construct appears in every program that I've ever written because\nsomewhere in there, you're going to deal with a list of stuff and so this is basically\nhow you walk the list and paint all the references. \n\nAnd you can see that each one of those individual references then is an anchor with an\nHREF and text that match the content of the directory listing.  And so basically,\nyou're just passing on a list of items and then they get painted by a few lines of\ncode like that.  So that kind of construct you'll see in almost every application your\nwrite. \n\nOkay, another nice thing that this allows us to do is to define our site level\nnavigation.  And so here what I've done is I've used the Twitter Bootstrap nav bar for\ncreating a set of links that I want to have specific kinds of information.  And so\nthis kind of a construct would appear in your layout HTML and then every page would\nautomatically get that without redefining that construct.  So this gives you one place\nto define things.  It makes your code really clean. \n\nAnother thing that you might want to do is you might want to provide some front-end\njob script manipulation.  So in this case what I've done is just referenced a [J]\nquery library and then I don't really have to do anything else and now all of a sudden\nI can manipulate front-end objects in all my pages if this were in the base page. \n\nOkay, now we've got styling in our application.  The next thing that we need to work\non is getting documents.  \n\nInterviewer:\tWe're doing this as [inaudible 53:01] can be really nice if you show what\nthe applets look like so far. \n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\n**Document (6 Tricks)**\nBrowseDirectory\nReadFile\nWriteFile\nExecuteScript\nTextToHtml\nSearchText\n\nRespondent:\tOkay now we're going to work on a set of tricks dealing with manipulating\ndocuments.  The first thing that I always do when I learn a new programming language is I\nalways figure out how to be able to walk the file system because I often need to\nmanipulate either directories or files in the file system.  And so this is one of the\nfirst things that I always need to do.  \n\nAnd so here we see an example of a directory listing where we give the directory name\non the URL.  We map that to a function in the views code called list view and then,\ninside list view, we take in that path name that came in through the URL and we go out\nand enumerate the contents of that particular directory, stick it in a Python variable\ncalled files, hand it off to our template, who knows how to paint a list of files.  So\nin roughly less than 10 lines of code, we have now created a file listing interface to\nour application.  \n\nOkay, the next thing that we're going to want to do is we're going to want to open one\nof those files and reading all the text.  And so here's an example of how you would\nwant to do that.  We take in the URL that names the file, we map that URL to a\nfunction called read view in the views [class].  Then inside of read view, we open the\ncontents of that path and then we read all of the characters out of that and we stick\nit in a variable called text.  And then we have a template that we just hand text to\nand it paints all that.  So here we have roughly six lines of code and we have the\nability to display a file in HTML, assuming the file is HTML. \n\nWriting is just about the same and here what we've done is we have created a log\nfunction so that every time I hit a page, I want to record the fact that I hit that\npage.  And so I've created a function called log that I can imbed in all of my\ndifferent views that will keep a history of page hits in a text file on my machine.\nAnd the way it does that is it appends to a file and it formats the date of the hit\nand then which user was logged in and then the name of the page that they were\nhitting.  So that's all imbedded in this log function.  \n\nAnd then I could use that log function in any view that -- just to create a passive\nlogger so that I can get a history of all of the activity on my website.  So you don't\nnecessarily need to imbed a heavyweight logging tool, you can just build your own\nlogging in roughly four or five lines of code. \n\nInterviewer:\tSo how does this get then passed on to the page that you're requesting\nbecause I though URLs only looked for the first match on the regular expression. \n\nRespondent:\tThis URL is going to map to the record view thing and then record view is just\ngoing to return home.  In fact, its on -- this is basically going to double hop your\nthing.  Its not actually going to do anything useful.  It's just going to redirect to some\nother page.  But what I was really trying to illustrate is not the handler for that, but\nhow easy it is to imbed logging in other views.  Presumably you have some more interesting\nlogic that you want, but in just a few lines of code, you could write a custom logger. \n\nInterviewer:\tOkay.  You're not demonstrating how to double intercept.  \n\nRespondent:\tCorrect.  Okay, the next thing that we might want to do is we might want to\nexecute shell commands.  In this example, what I've done is I've allowed certain scripts\nto be run and I look up those scripts and I execute them because they are shell scripts.  \n\nAnd so here what I'm doing is I'm taking in URLs where the command is a part of the\nURL name and then I'm executing the file using this [P] open and giving it -- I'm\nsupplying the command name and then I'm taking all of its output and passing it back\nto the [caller].  And so here what I'm doing is I'm actually invoking some command and\nthen I'm going to create a page that shows both the command and the result of\nexecuting that command.  Again, very few lines of code and its the magic of Python\nthat's really giving us this huge leverage factor.  \n\nAnother thing that I typically do in virtually all the programs that I write is I want\nto do some formatting and I have some fairly sophisticated tools that deal with things\nlike wiki formatting and extracting hyperlinks and maybe I want to write some tools\nthat actually do some remote lookups and maybe do some command execution or whatever. \n\nSo typically what I have is I have all my pages go through a command that can be\narbitrarily sophisticated and has nothing to do with the web infrastructure.  So I ran\nmy websites so that they deal with web pages and URLs in all of the infrastructure\nabout dealing with the web, I concentrate in one, but all my business logic, I have\nisolated in worker functions that may have a different lifecycle than the rest of the\napplication.  \n\nAnd so here's an example of that type of a thing.  The way that I paint a document on\nthe screen is I call this function format document that may do a bunch of arbitrary\nthings and one of the things that it may do is invoke an external program that does a\nbunch of stuff that my web system knows nothing about.  What it does know is that, by\nthe time this wiki HTML format command is done, its going to produce a block of output\nand then I'm going to pass that block of output onto the web page for display.  \n\nBut this allows you to build a system that is very, very decoupled and so that you can\nchange your business rules and it has zero impact on your web base infrastructure,\nvery important for the long life of the system. \n\nAnother thing that's really handy to do is you might want to search all the objects in\nyour database for a particular piece of text.  And so here's just a simple example of\ngetting all the filters -- getting all of the objects by filtering them, based on\nwhether the name contains the word, Bill.  And so this one thing will give you all the\nBills in the system and then that's being passed on to the template as a variable\ncalled people.  \n\n**Users (7 Tricks)**\nAdminImage\nAdminInterface\nUserLogin\nEnforcingSecurity\nDetailsImage\nEditUser\nListUsers\n\nOkay, now we have built an application, we've been able to work with data, we've been\nable to work with views, construct views, we've been able to style those views and now\nwe've been able to manipulate the underlying file system and work with documents. \n\nNow we're ready to work with user authentication.  There's really two parts that we\nwant to do.  The first is that we want to authorize a particular user.  We want to --\nthere's two parts to working with users.  The first part is to authenticate that a\nparticular -- that we know who a particular user is.  The second part is to allow them\na certain level of privilege and that's called authorization.\n\nDjango provides both of these facilities with great ease.  In about two lines of code,\nyou can enable a whole user auth system that has amazingly good capabilities; very\nnice, secure, robust, easy to implement and turn on.  And I highly recommend not\nbuilding your own user authentication system, but just enabling the one that is\nprovided to you.  \n\nAt its base level, it gives you a number of objects that you have a nice user\ninterface too so you can manage the users in your system.  And this is how you turn on\nthe user auth system.  The first thing that you need to do is include the access to\nthe import libraries and then the next thing that you need to do is tell Django that\nyou're using the built-in authentication system and then the last thing that you need\nto do is you need to map all the URLs that start with admin to be handled by the\nbuilt-in library.  That's all you need to do.  So all you're really telling it is\nevery time somebody types in a URL that starts with admin, it must be for you and then\nyou get all this user interface for free.  \n\nHere's an example of adding login and logout to your application.  So here what we're\ndoing is we're picking off the login and logout URLs and then we just map them to the\ndefault handling of those same functions.  So we don't actually have to provide any\nuser interface or anything and all of the business rules about what happened with a\nfailed login and resetting my password and I forgot my password and email me so that I\ncan get a reset link, all of that stuff is done for you.  You don't have to do any\nwork to do that. \n\nOkay, this is an example of the authorization piece.  Here what we're doing is we're\ngoing to require that, if you hit the home page that you have to be logged in in order\nto see the home page.  And what that decorator does, the login required decorator is\nthat, if you are not authenticated when you hit the home page, you'll be mapped\nautomatically.  You'll be redirected to the login screen.  Again, one line of code and\nnow all of a sudden, we have checking. \n\nAnd so you can have certain views that can be universally accessed, but you add the\nlogin required decorator anyplace in your system where you decide that you want to\ncontrol permissions.  And there are a number of other decorators' variations on this\nthat allow you to -- only allow super users to have access to this or only require a\nspecific user or user group privileges to be able to do certain things. \n\nOne of the things that I love about Django is that easy things are easy and hard\nthings are possible and that's the right combination.  Easy things should be trivial.  \n\nOkay now what we're going to do here is we are going to be able to look at not only\nall of the built-in types that Django has that they have offered for us that they\nautomatically put in our database, but we are wanting to get nice customized views of\nour specific data types.  So for example, the note thing that we created, once we've\ncreated that data type, now we can edit that data type, automatically writing zero\nadditional code. \n\nSome of the data types for the built-in things are really sophisticated.  For example,\nyou can see in this edit box for the user that they have [salting] of the passwords\nand they have the forgot my password thing and there's a whole bunch of business\nlogic.  There's probably thousands of lines of code implementing business logic that\nyou have no business re-implementing yourself when a team of experts did that for you.  \n\nAnd then another nice thing is that any tables can be shown as a list and so that you\ncan drill down in and you can look at all of the fields across all of your different\ndata types, which is built-in user interface stuff, again, writing no code at all.\nAll you did was hook up the admin interface. \n\nOkay, so now we've got user authentication in our system and we've written about five\nlines of code total to get all of these rough indication stuff looked up.  It also\nsaved us many, many hours, maybe a month's worth of hard work. \n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\n**Project (5 Tricks)**\nTricksInventory\nEstimateCost\nTestDrivenDevelopment\nHostYourApp\nDeployApp\n\nOkay now the last set of tricks that we're going to look at is some global project\nmanagement tricks.  And this kind of takes advantage of the capabilities of Django,\nbut is not necessarily specific to Django.  \n\nThe first trick that I recommend is that you analyze your next project and you\nactually do an inventory of all of the tricks that you're going to need.  Then you're\ngoing to -- and many times when people first start analyzing a project, they end up\nwith big tasks that need to be done.  I would say break those tasks down until you can\nget down to the level of identifying specific tricks.  And so you want to keep\ndecomposing until you feel like I can do this in an hour if I knew the trick.  \n\nThen do an inventory of how many times you've used that trick already.  If you've\napplied a specific trick five or six times, it will probably only take you an hour.\nBut if you've never done that trick before then you have to factor in both the\nlearning, as well as the doing.\n\nInterviewer:\tIts probably a day.\n\n\nRespondent:\tIt will probably take you a day the first time and every time you do a trick,\nyou can cut that time in half, down to about an hour.  So then you can estimate the\ncost just by rolling those things out.  You can take how many tricks that you've got,\nfigure out how many tricks you already know.  You can apply a trick in an hour, learn\nthe trick in a day.  So that gives you a really accurate estimate.  \n\nSo this is a typical project that I work on is that it has 50 tricks.  I know 40 of\nthem.  So it's going to take me about 40 hours to apply the tricks I already know.\nBut there's 10 tricks that I don't know yet.  Those 10 tricks are going to take me\ntwice the amount of time as the 40 tricks that I already know and that's typical of a\nproject.  So what this says is that two-thirds of my time spent on this project is\ngoing to be learning what I don't know already.  \n\nThe next thing that I highly recommend is use test-driven development.  Accelerate\nyour project by creating a process of rapid iteration.  And when I mean rapid, I think\nyou should be able to add a new feature every five minutes.  And so what you want to\nfind is how to create on line of code to add a new feature and to create one line of\ncode to add a new test and then what you want to do is you want to write your test\nbefore you write your code.  \n\nThis is not hard because you're only writing one line of test code and then you're writing\none line of product code and you should be able to turn that wheel in about five minutes.\nTest hourly,daily and weekly at different levels of depth and then deploy all of your code\nonly when the testpassed.  There's no point in deploying bad code.  And, if you haven't\ntested it, it is bad code.\n\nSo the next thing is host your web application.  The first time that you have to host\nan application, it will probably take about a day.  And after that, you can probably\ndeploy your app in an hour.  While I like a web host called WebFaction, they have very\ncheap sites and you can set them up and get going very quickly.  They have control\npanel, operations that allow you to set up the URLs and map them and they create a\nstatic server for you to serve up your images and JavaScript libraries and thingslike\nthat.  And so it's a largely point-and-click and then they allow you to bind yourweb\napplication to specific domains.  One of the tricks that I like is I have many\ndifferent domains serve off the same web application.  So I have one app thatserves\nprobably 20 different domains.\n\nThe next thing that you want to do is you want to deploy your application.  So I\nreally like a tool called Get that allows me to create a new repository by calling\n[Getanet] to check-in everything that's been modified, added or deleted, with one\ncommand, where you get commit.  And then I can push my application to share with the\nrepository or any other people that are using that repository with a single command\ncode get push and then I can do that remotely.  I can redeploy my application by just\ndoing SSA [inaudible 01:15:36] get pull. \n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\n**Follow Up**\nSourceCode\nHelpMe\nDjangoDocs\nRelatedTopics\n\nAll of the source code that I've showed is on my GitHub repository and the slide\npresentation is located on my website.

Jesus gives us three examples\nof activities that can be used to impress others. \n\n\n * Giving\n * Praying\n * Fasting\nIf we do these things to be seen then our reward is paid in full, once we are seen.  But\ntrue desire to bring glory to God, is richly rewarded.  When we really want him, then that\nis what we get.\n\n\nMat 6:1-16\n\nWatch out! Dont do your good deeds publicly, to be admired by others, for you will lose the reward from your Father in heaven. When you give to someone in need, dont do as the hypocrites doblowing trumpets in the synagogues and streets to call attention to their acts of charity! I tell you the truth, they have received all the reward they will ever get. But when you give to someone in need, dont let your left hand know what your right hand is doing. Give your gifts in private, and your Father, who sees everything, will reward you.\n\nWhen you pray, dont be like the hypocrites who love to pray publicly on street corners and in the synagogues where everyone can see them. I tell you the truth, that is all the reward they will ever get. But when you pray, go away by yourself, shut the door behind you, and pray to your Father in private. Then your Father, who sees everything, will reward you.\n\nWhen you pray, dont babble on and on as people of other religions do. They think their prayers are answered merely by repeating their words again and again. Dont be like them, for your Father knows exactly what you need even before you ask him!\n\nAnd when you fast, dont make it obvious, as the hypocrites do, for they try to look miserable and disheveled so people will admire them for their fasting. I tell you the truth, that is the only reward they will ever get. But when you fast, comb your hair and wash your face. Then no one will notice that you are fasting, except your Father, who knows what you do in private. And your Father, who sees everything, will reward you.\n\n\nQuestions\n\n1.

As we are blessed by God then we begin the propser.  Wealth is a true danger for us.  We can forget how much we really need God.  This is the same pattern that we see repeated many times in scripture.  We need to preserve our dependence on God, or it will eventually destroy us.\n\n\nDeuteronomy 8:6 So obey the commands of the Lord your God by walking in his ways and fearing him.  For the Lord your God is bringing you into a good land of flowing streams and pools of water, with fountains and springs that gush out in the valleys and hills. It is a land where food is plentiful and nothing is lacking. It is a land where iron is as common as stone, and copper is abundant in the hills.  When you have eaten your fill, be sure to praise the Lord your God for the good land he has given you.\n\nBut that is the time to be careful! Beware that in your plenty you do not forget the Lord your God and disobey his commands, regulations, and decrees that I am giving you today.  For when you have become full and prosperous and have built fine homes to live in,  and when your flocks and herds have become very large and your silver and gold have multiplied along with everything else, be careful! \n\nDo not become proud at that time and forget the Lord your God, who rescued you from slavery in the land of Egypt.  Do not forget that he led you through the great and terrifying wilderness with its poisonous snakes and scorpions, where it was so hot and dry. He gave you water from the rock! He fed you with manna in the wilderness, a food unknown to your ancestors. He did this to humble you and test you for your own good.  He did all this so you would never say to yourself, I have achieved this wealth with my own strength and energy. Remember the Lord your God. He is the one who gives you power to be successful, in order to fulfill the covenant he confirmed to your ancestors with an oath.\n\nBut I assure you of this: If you ever forget the Lord your God and follow other gods, worshiping and bowing down to them, you will certainly be destroyed. Just as the Lord has destroyed other nations in your path, you also will be destroyed if you refuse to obey the Lord your God.\n\n\nQuestions\n\n1. How does this passage apply to us? \n\n2.

But true disciples\nare more interested in just following Jesus.  Our heart reveals our truest nature.  Jesus\nis calling us to pursue him rather than religious activities and attitudes.\n\n \nMatthew 15:1-20\n\nSome Pharisees and teachers of religious law now arrived from Jerusalem to see\nJesus. They asked him, Why do your disciples disobey our age-old tradition? For they\nignore our tradition of ceremonial hand washing before they eat.\n\nJesus replied, And why do you, by your traditions, violate the direct commandments of\nGod?  For instance, God says, Honor your father and mother, and Anyone who speaks\ndisrespectfully of father or mother must be put to death.  But you say it is all right for\npeople to say to their parents, Sorry, I cant help you. For I have vowed to give to God\nwhat I would have given to you. In this way, you say they dont need to honor their\nparents. And so you cancel the word of God for the sake of your own tradition.\n\nYou hypocrites! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you, for he wrote,\n\nThese people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me.\n\nTheir worship is a farce, for they teach man-made ideas as commands from God.\n\nThen Jesus called to the crowd to come and hear. Listen, he said, and try to\nunderstand. 11Its not what goes into your mouth that defiles you; you are defiled by the\nwords that come out of your mouth.\n\nThen the disciples came to him and asked, Do you realize you offended the Pharisees by\nwhat you just said?\n\nJesus replied, Every plant not planted by my heavenly Father will be uprooted, 14so\nignore them. They are blind guides leading the blind, and if one blind person guides\nanother, they will both fall into a ditch.\n\nThen Peter said to Jesus, Explain to us the parable that says people arent defiled by\nwhat they eat.\n\nDont you understand yet? Jesus asked. Anything you eat passes through the stomach\nand then goes into the sewer. But the words you speak come from the heartthats what\ndefiles you. For from the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, all sexual\nimmorality, theft, lying, and slander. These are what defile you.

We cannot serve two\nmasters.  We must choose whether wealth, comfort, and power will be at the center of our\naffections or a desire to follow God.  Whatever we choose will define what our life will become.\n\n\nMatthew 6\n\nDont store up treasures here on earth, where moths eat them and rust destroys them, and where thieves break in and steal. Store your treasures in heaven, where moths and rust cannot destroy, and thieves do not break in and steal. Wherever your treasure is, there the desires of your heart will also be.\n\n  Your eye is a lamp that provides light for your body. When your eye is good, your whole body is filled with light. But when your eye is bad, your whole body is filled with darkness. And if the light you think you have is actually darkness, how deep that darkness is!\n\n  No one can serve two masters. For you will hate one and love the other; you will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money.\n\n  That is why I tell you not to worry about everyday lifewhether you have enough food and drink, or enough clothes to wear. Isnt life more than food, and your body more than clothing? Look at the birds. They dont plant or harvest or store food in barns, for your heavenly Father feeds them. And arent you far more valuable to him than they are? Can all your worries add a single moment to your life?\n\n  And why worry about your clothing? Look at the lilies of the field and how they grow. They dont work or make their clothing, yet Solomon in all his glory was not dressed as beautifully as they are. And if God cares so wonderfully for wildflowers that are here today and thrown into the fire tomorrow, he will certainly care for you. Why do you have so little faith?\n\n  So dont worry about these things, saying, What will we eat? What will we drink? What will we wear? These things dominate the thoughts of unbelievers, but your heavenly Father already knows all your needs. Seek the Kingdom of God above all else, and live righteously, and he will give you everything you need.\n\n  So dont worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will bring its own worries. Todays trouble\n  is enough for today.\n\n\nQuestions\n\n1. How can we measure where our real treasure is?\n\n2.

Christ\ndied for our sins, just as the Scriptures said. He was buried, and he was raised from the\ndead on the third day, just as the Scriptures said. He was seen by Peter and then by the\nTwelve. After that, he was seen by more than 500 of his followers at one time, most of\nwhom are still alive, though some have died. Then he was seen by James and later by all\nthe apostles. Last of all, as though I had been born at the wrong time, I also saw\nhim. For I am the least of all the apostles. In fact, Im not even worthy to be called an\napostle after the way I persecuted Gods church.\n\nI Co 15:19\nFor if there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ has not been raised either. And\nif Christ has not been raised, then all our preaching is useless, and your faith is\nuseless. And we apostles would all be lying about Godfor we have said that God raised\nChrist from the grave. But that cant be true if there is no resurrection of the\ndead. And if there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ has not been raised.

He had been tormented\nfor many years by a large group of demons.  Jesus confronted the demons and forced them to\nleave the man.  The demons entered a large group of pigs which ran over a cliff and drowned.\n\n\nMark 5\n\nSo they arrived at the other side of the lake, in the region of the Gerasenes. When Jesus\nclimbed out of the boat, a man possessed by an evil spirit came out from a cemetery to\nmeet him. This man lived among the burial caves and could no longer be restrained, even\nwith a chain. Whenever he was put into chains and shacklesas he often washe snapped the\nchains from his wrists and smashed the shackles. No one was strong enough to subdue\nhim. Day and night he wandered among the burial caves and in the hills, howling and\ncutting himself with sharp stones.\n\nWhen Jesus was still some distance away, the man saw him, ran to meet him, and bowed low\nbefore him. With a shriek, he screamed, Why are you interfering with me, Jesus, Son of\nthe Most High God? In the name of God, I beg you, dont torture me! For Jesus had\nalready said to the spirit, Come out of the man, you evil spirit.\n\nThen Jesus demanded, What is your name?\n\nAnd he replied, My name is Legion, because there are many of us inside this man. Then\nthe evil spirits begged him again and again not to send them to some distant place.\n\nThere happened to be a large herd of pigs feeding on the hillside nearby. Send us into\nthose pigs, the spirits begged. Let us enter them.\n\nSo Jesus gave them permission. The evil spirits came out of the man and entered the\npigs, and the entire herd of 2,000 pigs plunged down the steep hillside into the lake\nand drowned in the water.\n\nThe herdsmen fled to the nearby town and the surrounding countryside, spreading the news\nas they ran. People rushed out to see what had happened. A crowd soon gathered around\nJesus, and they saw the man who had been possessed by the legion of demons. He was\nsitting there fully clothed and perfectly sane, and they were all afraid. Then those who\nhad seen what happened told the others about the demon-possessed man and the pigs. And\nthe crowd began pleading with Jesus to go away and leave them alone.\n\nAs Jesus was getting into the boat, the man who had been demon possessed begged to go\nwith him. But Jesus said, No, go home to your family, and tell them everything the Lord\nhas done for you and how merciful he has been.

We stop listening to the\nunderlying truth of the what God is saying to us.  This is especially true if we are using an\noutdated translation with language that we would never use in the hardware store.\n\nI've recently begun a practice that helps me to hear the bible afresh.  The practice is fairly\nsimple but the results have been profound.  You may also find this practice useful to you.\n\nSelect a chapter of the bible that is a favorite.  Read each verse and put it into words that you\nwould use with a high school student.  Try to convey the same meaning without using any of the\noriginal words from the passage.  In order to do this you must grapple with what is really being\nsaid.\n\nNext, apply the passage to your life situation.  How is the Spirit speaking into your family,\ncareer, schooling, or personal life?  This is more than an intellectual exercise.  It involves\nresponding emotionally to what God is speaking about your specific life.\n\nThe third step, is to personalize the conversation.  Write the passage out as a personal letter from\nJesus to you.  Recognize that he has been speaking through this whole process.  Receive this\ncommunication as an expression of his love.\n\nConsider writing out each of these three stages.  Read and edit the passage while listening for the\nvoice of the Spirit. The goal is not to provide an accurate translation, that can stand up to\nscholarly criticism, but rather to encounter the living God.\n\nLimit the scope to one or two paragraphs.  Let this fully soak in for several days before continuing\non. You may find this so helpful that you process long passages of scripture.  But remember, that\nthis is about depth not breadth.  The goal is to hear from God on a personal level.\n\nAs you hear God speaking directly and personally to you, the results can be dramatic.  What once\nwere vaguely encouraging passages, become deeply personal expressions of love and commitment.  I\nhope that you find this practice as useful as I have.\n", "user": 3, "title": "Familiarity Breeds Complacency"}}, {"pk": 178, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/MyBook/Public/SpiritualGrowth/Practices/WorkingAndPraying", "time": "2014-06-15T20:36:29.211", "text": "* Working And Praying *                 -*-muse-*-\n\nOne of the ironies of following Christ is the idea of having a partnership with God.  Some believe\nthat spiritual success is the result of hard work.  They can earn acceptance with God and victory\nover sin by shere force of will. \n\nOthers feel that everything important will happen supernaturally.  This does not require any effort\non our part but is a miraculous provision of God.  Both of these viewpoints fail to recognize the\npartnership.\n\nWhen Jesus calls disciples to follow him, there is act act of both his will and ours. We respond to\nGod by aligning our expectations with his purpose.  These are not naturally aligned and it\nforces a decision.  Will we say, \"yes\", to his purpose or attempt to get our own way?\n\nThis is not a one time battle, but one that we must fight constantly.  We must repeatedly lay down\nour expectations in order to accept God's ultimate purpose for us.\n\nAs we know the Spirit at a deeper level we are transformed by the experience.  Our expectations and\ndesires truly begin to align with God's plans for us.  \n\nSpiritual transformation is the process of our hopes and dreams being aligned with God's purpose.\nThe very thing that Jesus wants for us is the thing that we want for ourselves.  As we are\ntransformed the conflict that we have with God is greatly reduced.\n\nWhen our wills become aligned with God's will then we can wholeheartedly pursue our dreams.  We know\nthat because we want his purpose then we can boldly continue to fullfill our wildest dreams.\n\nThe most important part of prayer, is to discover God's will for us, not just to express our\ndesires.  We are wanting to align our will to his, not the other way around.\n\nToo much of our prayer is focused on getting God to do our thing.  But as we seek to do God's thing,\nwe discover the peace that comes from being aligned with God's ultimate purpose.\n\nIt requires humility to admit that our desires and expectations are misaligned with God.  But true\ntransformation begins by seeing the gap and accepting God's right to call the shots.\n", "user": 3, "title": "Working And Praying"}}, {"pk": 179, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/MyBook/Public/SpiritualGrowth/Practices/ThoughtsOnPrayer", "time": "2014-06-15T20:36:29.407", "text": "* Thoughts on Prayer *                 -*-muse-*-\n\nRecently, I have been really challenged to grow deeper in my prayer life. I have realized just how\nshallow my prayer life really is.  It is not clear how we grow in prayer or even what the final\ndestination is.\n\nThe Lord has shown me some of both of these.  I started reading a book, called \"Prayer as a Place\",\nby Charles Bello.  It discusses many different forms of prayer that I have not encountered before.\nSeveral people at the Vineyard Missions Conference had recommended it, so I thought it would be worth\na try.\n\nFrom the very beginning of the book I have been challenged to think about my prayer life very\ndifferently.  The author describes how the various spiritual practices are designed to help us\nencounter God in different ways.\n\nThere is an upward movement including practices like worship, thanksgiving, and adoration.  There is\nan outward movement involving practices of evangelism, petition, and intercession.  And finally,\nthere is an inward movement involving practices like bible meditation, experiencing God's presence,\nrepentance, confession, and inner healing.\n\nProtestants are pretty good at the first two, but almost totally unaware of the inward journey.  Our\nexperience of God is always \"out there\", but we are afraid to encounter God in the quiet moments\nwhere we protect our inner-most thoughts.\n\nThis ultimately leads to a dual-life where we become increasingly protective of our public presence.\nWe won't let anyone near our private selves.  We shut that off from our closest friends, God, and\neven ourselves.\n\nAs we invite God into our inner-sanctum, it may be painful at first.  But he also brings the healing\nthat we so desperately need.  As we receive his love, we are able to trust others with more access\nto our private lives.\n\nThis describes the journey that I have started in the last few weeks.  It is both exhilarating and\nfrightening at the same time.\n", "user": 3, "title": "Thoughts on Prayer"}}, {"pk": 180, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/MyBook/Public/SpiritualGrowth/Practices/Virtues", "time": "2014-06-15T20:36:29.644", "text": "* Virtues *                                       -*-muse-*-\n\n    Love (Justice)\n    Joy (Contentment)\n    Peace (Courage)\n    Patience (Humility)\n    Kindness (Compassion)\n    Goodness (Sacrifice)\n    Faithfulness (Perseverence)\n    Gentleness (Mercy)\n    Self-control (Discipline)\n    Faith (Trust)\n    Hope (Confidence)\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Virtues"}}, {"pk": 181, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/MyBook/Public/SpiritualGrowth/Practices/TryingHarder", "time": "2014-06-15T20:36:29.836", "text": "* Trying Harder *                 -*-muse-*-\n\nWhen it comes to loving God and others, trying harder does not get us any closer.  I often view my\nattempts to become more loving as a gauge for my rating with God. It is a fruitless ploy to try and\nearn approval from him. But he already loves me as much as he ever will.  There is nothing that can\nbe done to justify his love for me.\n\nSometimes I confuse my desire to love others with my own needs and agenda.  I may feel better about\nmyself when I am serving others. This can easily become the actual motivation for serving.  The activity\nmay be valid but the emotional motivation is not.  If I am serving others for my own benefit then it\nis not really about true love.\n\nThis self-serving attitude just doesn't work. Doing holy activities for corrupted reasons ends up in\nreligious bondage and hypocrisy.  Instead I need the transformation of the Holy Spirit to give me a\nlegitimate desire to love others more.\n\nThe key issue is not giving more but receiving more.  I accept love, forgiveness, and nurture from\nGod. These things change my capacity to give them away to others.\n\nThis is not simply a transaction motivated by self-interest.  I don't try to love others to feel\ngood and build self esteem.  Instead, I accept his love freely.  This produces a desire within to\nserve others.\n\nThis all begins by allowing God to impact my emotions with the full weight of his love.

Evaluate your dreams.  How are you fulfilling them?\nLet this be a focal power in your prayer time.  Your deepest dreams are a reflection of God's purpose\nfor you.  God gradually changes what you most desire.\n\nBecause of this transformation, we can be confident that he will give us his dreams.   These are a\ndirect reflection of his purpose for our lives.  Of course, this is only true to the extent that we\nare following him.  It is not simply automatic because we call ourselves Christian.\n\nGod will fulfill every desire that he has placed within you.  You get your deepest needs met because\nthey are completely aligned with his purpose for you.

Your\ndreams are a unique reflection of God's plan for you.\n\nThis is also why the process of transformation can be painful.  The Lord messes with the things that\nyou most value.   He is continuously shaping your desires.  When he is done you will look a lot more\nlike him.\n\nThis plan is specific to you, so don't let anyone else define what you ought to be.  God will reveal\nhis purpose to you as you seek to be obedient to him.  The dreams that you have for your life are\none of the primary ways that God guides you. \n\nTake the time to get in touch with the things that you really long for.

Although this sounds like a\nplatitude that every believer would agree with, I often deny it by trusting in other things.\n\nAccepting Jesus as our Lord is not a one-time act, but a continual posture of the heart.  Each day\npresents many opportunities to seek or deny him.\n\nHe has a wonderful plan for each day of my life.  Yet, I frequently opt for my own short-sighted\ngoals instead.  I am often so blind to the implications of doing this and the consequences of not\npursuing him wholeheartedly.\n\nI have been thinking about this process a lot lately.  I want to follow God in every way.  At the\nsame time, I want to be in control. This creates a built-in conflict.\n\nThe bible teaches us that Jesus is the one that starts the work of redemption in us. We can not\nmuster either the desire or the ability in ourselves.\n\nWhat is true at the beginning, holds throughout our lives.  He continually sustains the\ntransformation.  Will power is not enough to do the deep work required.\n\nI experience this on a personal level when I spend time alone with God.  I pick a quiet and isolated\nspot and invite him to make me aware of his presence. This gives him an opportunity to speak\nwhile I am consciously listening to him.\n\nMy practice is simply to look at him, while he looks at me.  This is sometimes a supernatural\nexperience where he touches my spirit and brings refreshing.  He may bring his peace, plans, or\ncorrection to me in that quiet place of openness.  \n\nAt other times, nothing much happens, but we enjoy each other's company.  These times of solitude\nhave a lingering effect throughout my day.  I am more aware of his presence in the middle of life's\nturmoil.\n\nThis practice of being alone with God and quietly enjoying his presence has become the most\nimportant activity that I have neglected for so many years.\n", "user": 3, "title": "God Is The Source"}}, {"pk": 186, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/MyBook/Public/SpiritualGrowth/Practices/ReleaseControl", "time": "2014-06-15T20:36:30.654", "text": "* Release Control *                 -*-muse-*-\n\nMany internal conflicts I experience are related to control.  As God is molding me into\nhis image, he is uncovering these issues.  I need to embrace his work.\n\nThe issues of contentment, simplicity, and generosity are primarily about control. Contentment comes\nfrom reliquishing control of expectations.  Simplicity is focusing only on essential things in\norder to eliminate everything else.  Generosity is the natural consequence of a lifestyle that is\nopen to others.\n\nEach of these areas are interrelated and require a sacrifice of control. My life is not really\nabout me.  It is about bringing glory to the Creator of the Universe.\n\nI continually struggle with performance.  I have a deep emotional need to achieve. This becomes\nunhealthy when my performance is the basis for acceptance. This is just a control issue diguised as\nneeding a sense of purpose.\n\nWhat is motivating this drive?   Is it a true desire to honor God, or do I believe that I can\ngenerate my own emotional feelings of self-worth?\n\nContentment in achievement is a major issue for me.  My natural tendency is to ignore everything\nthat has already been accomplished to reach for the next set of goals.  Even the largest successes\nhave an emotional half-life of a single day. If I were to win a Nobel Prize then after a week I\nstart to wonder what I have done for the last week.\n\nSimplicity means having smaller goals. I feel that each new goal has to be added onto all other\nexisting goals. Every day I feel the burden of building this giant pyrimid of interconnected goals.\nSimplicity is saying \"No\" to this self-inflicted disease.\n\nGenerosity is shifting the focus from meeting my need to those of someone else.  Instead of doing\ntasks that meet my goals, I am focusing on things that serve the needs of others.  Generosity is the\nnatural behavior resulting from this transformation.  Jesus gave freeley to me so I can pass the\nblessing on.\n\nAll three of these areas touch me at a place of emotional neediness. I long for the Spirit of God to\nset me free from the unrealistic demands that tend to dominate my life.

It is not meant to enhance the self at the cost of maintaining concern for\nothers. Instead, solitude is a way to enrich the self in order that we may more fully join\nwith others. Solitude is meant to enrich the practice of community.\n\nWhile community is the reality we are to live, solitude helps us to live there. Nouwen\nsays that \"community ... is primarily a quality of the heart.\" It is not primarily a\nmatter of particular structures. It is first of all a recognition that in the faces of\nother people, I am aware of Christ's call to interdependence, sharing, serving,\nreceiving, mutuality, encouragement, and companionship. Community is thus, first of all,\na particular vision of life.\n\nBut it also involves a practical joining together. Nouwen notes that \"we will never know\nwhat community is if we never come together in one place.\" Heart and hands must therefore\nmeet. Ideals must find a practical outworking. Our dreams of cooperation and sharing life\ntogether must be realized with courage and perseverance in an age characterized by\nindependence, self-sufficiency, and isolation.\n\nIn the quest of realizing our dreams, we need to make sure that the matter of the heart\ndoes not get lost through a preoccupation with the structures of community.\n\nCharles R Ringma.

That is where hope and dreams\ncan be persistently sustained.  In the solitude resolutions are forged and difficult commitments\nmade.  There intimacy can flourish and our life is renewed and transformed.  We must maintain our inner\nlife or our strength will weaken and our resolve will dissipate.\n\nIn the solitude we must meet with God and wrestle with the issues that threaten to destroy us.  This\nis the place where we truly find him. It is ironic that it is also where we discover our true selves\nas well. Knowing God reveals things about us that we would rather hide.\n\nThere is no substitute.  If we don't take time to be alone with God, then we will never grow very\ndeep.  Youth is fleeting, but immaturity can last a lifetime.  We need time to connect at an\nemotional level with our creator.\n\nThis is the most valuable time that we will ever spend.

But for years, I have viewed prayer as something\nI ought to do.  Recently prayer times have taken on a lot more listening, and a lot less striving to\nget it right.\n\nWe seldom inform God of anything. God does not really require our help to know what needs done. This\nsounds a bit outlandish, but it is totally how we feel.  Prayer is more about simply being with God,\nand enjoying his presence. Nothing more.  We may discuss needs as a part of that relationship, or not.\n\nIn prayer we find peace and rest from the struggle of life.  As we embrace God's Spirit in our inner\nmost place, we tap into the true source of peace.  Let's face it.  This life is loud, demanding,\nstressful, and often hostile.  We desparately need Jesus daily to make sense of the heartbreak that\nwe all experience.\n\nGod longs to invite us into his plans.  We all long to live lives that matter.  Purpose is not\nsomething that we invent for ourselves.  But it is something that we hear from God.  During prayer\nthe Lord is able to whisper his plans for me.  It is in when I am most receptive that I am likely to\nhear what God intends.\n\nPrayer is where we experience companionship and intimacy with God.  Prayer is like having a date\nnight with your spouse.  It is possible to do it and have a bad time together. But by committing to\nspend time with one another regularly, you will inevitably find times of real joy and\nrefreshing. Prayer is a time for companionship and discussing any concerns.\n\nAll conversations go better with more listening, and less talking.

These are the core issues of everyday\nlife.  This is where our vague desire to follow God is tested, and where spiritual transformation\ntakes place.\n\nWe live is a society that is obsessed with getting more.  We need more money, more time, more\nrecognition, more stuff, more control over others, and even more control over God.  This\nself-centered orientation lies at the heart of our unhappiness.\n\nLet's face it.  How much is enough?  If you are honest, you probably believe that you could be happy\nif you had 20% more than you have right now.  But the horizon keeps moving.  \n\nIf you are discontent now you will remain discontent until Jesus transforms your desires.  There is\nno point at which the false gods actually satisfy us.  The issue exists inside our skin.\n\nWhen we trust in the wrong things, then it is not possible to be at peace. No amount of success will\nmake us feel approved, and no size of bank account will make us feel secure.\n\nWe actually long for Jesus, but don't know it.  He is our only hope.  He is the provider, sustainer,\nhealer, and the security that we need.\n\nGod is calling us to accept his truth about ourselves and his role in our lives.  This leads us to\nhumbly acknowledge him and surrender the control over our lives.\n\nThis drama plays out in every area of our lives. Materialism compels us to work long hours and\nbuild complex plans to scratch the unscratchable itch.  We place demands on those around us to meet\nour every need, while at the same time being unwilling to sacrifice for their benefit. Ultimately,\nwe poison our relationships with our unending thirst for more recognition and control.\n\nJesus offers us freedom from this vicious cycle of destruction and dissatisfaction.  God always\nmeets each true need we ever have.  He is the one who brings people into our lives.  He grants to\neach of us the opportunities aligned with his plans.  He leads and guides us on the right path to\ntake.\n\nBeing in control is only an illusion.  God desires to replace this illusion with his actual\npresence. He will give us the provision, security, recognition, and peace that we need.\n\nThis is the work of spiritual transformation.  God changes us from the inside out.

We all know the signs... a growing disatifaction based on a\nrealization that our true dreams are unreachable.  This breeds a feeling of desparation and a desire\nto take unreasonable risks.\n\nDuring our twenties we spend most of our effort trying to gain a measure of success as adults.  This\nis a serious struggle for survival that every person must face.  We have won this struggle when we\nfeel that we are a true adult and that we have a plan for the future that will work.  \n\nIn our thirties most of us set about building a family and a carreer.  This is major effort\nrequiring us to make sacrifices for the people that we love.  We gladly make those investments\nbecause we see that the stakes are so high. We face tremendous barriers during this time to our\nsuccess. But we know it will be worth it in the end.\n\nOur forties are spent building on our previous successes and recovering from past failures. Major\nchallenges within our families, careers, and relationships loom everwhere. Most people begin to\nseriously question whether it is all worth it.  The primary challenge of this phase of life is\nfighting the resentment that comes from believing that the needs of others have taken precident over\nours.\n\nThe crisis comes as we see that our dreams are passing out of reach.  This is a serious situation\nthat causes us to want to throw everything away and start over again with a self-centered plan to\nmeet our own needs.  Many as they aproach fifty, get a new spouse, house, career, develop new\naddictions and abandon everything that they have worked so hard to achieve.\n\nThis is the natural path of our life.  Fortunately, Jesus provides a different path for those who\nare willing to follow him.  On this path we daily lay down our dreams, to follow him.  We don't have\nour dreams stolen by the demands of others.  Instead we offer them as a sacrifice to our king.\n\nThis places us in a very different emotional place.  We willingly live a life of pursuing God.  The\ndemands of others must take a back seat.  His goals and plans for us are more important than the\nneeds of others.\n\nAs we go through our lives we can always be confident that God's plan for us is still on track.  The\ncircumstances that we have are totally consistant with his plan for us.  The assumes that we are\nactually following his plan.  \n\nIn this way we never get to a point where we feel the need to throw everything away and pursue our\nown fullfillment.  Start today, don't delay.  No matter what age you are, you must begin pursuing\nGod's plan rather than your own.

This is not always an easy thing to do but it is\nnecessary. It is hard to inspire and motivate others if we can't even\ninspire ourselves. This can sometimes take some energy, but it is well\nworth the effort.\n\nJohn C. Maxwell wrote an excellent book on this subject, entitled\n'Today Matters'. In this book he describes the effects of the\ncommitments that we make in a number of different areas. Each\ncommitment that we make is established or undermined by our daily\nhabits. Once the emotion that produced the commitment fades, we are\nleft with these daily habits to carry us through.\n\nThere are twelve areas in which we make commitments that need to be\nserviced daily. These are what Maxwell calls the Daily Dozen. They\ninclude:\n\n * Attitude: Choose and display the right attitude.\n\n * Priority: Determine and act on important priorities.\n\n * Health: Know and follow healthy guidelines.\n\n * Family: Communicate and care for my family.\n\n * Thinking: Practice and develop good thinking.\n\n * Commitment: Make and keep proper commitments.\n\n * Finances: Make and properly manage money.\n\n * Faith: Deepen and live out my faith.\n\n * Relationships: Initiate and invest in solid relationships.\n\n * Generosity: Plan for and model generosity.\n\n * Values: Embrace and practice good values.\n\n * Growth: Seek and experience improvements.\n\nSelf-leadership involves all of these unique aspects. As we seek to be\nbetter leaders, we should start with ourselves. To be able to motivate\nand influence others, we must first work on our own daily\nhabits. Sometimes this is the most difficult step in leadership.\n\nTake a few minutes and score yourself against these personal\ncommitments. How do you fare?

Fully leverage your superpower while still accomplishing many tasks\nthat are outside of it. Using others to complete activities that are not part of your core strengths\nlets you concentrate on your areas of brilliance. However, delegation can be tricky. It's not\ncomplex, but it may be hard to figure out how to make it work well.\n\nI recommend setting up delegation as three components: selecting tasks, setting expectations, and\nverifying the results. Every task worth delegating is worth setting up in this way. You should\nconsciously think through each of these elements or just do the task yourself.\n\nNot every task should be delegated. They should be carefully selected using the following criteria:\n\n1. Does delegating this task save me significant time? If not don't delegate.\n\n2. Is the goal clear enough to communicate efficiently? If not then you may have to do so much\ncommunication and redirection that it loses the benefit you were hoping to achieve.\n\n3. Will you repeat this task many times? You get the biggest benefits from delegating tasks that can\nbe taught once and repeated many times without having to do additional training. Think about the\none-time setup costs and the setup costs associated with repeating the task.\n\nOnce you have selected the task it is time to set expectations. Start by deciding the objectives\nthat you have for the task. What will the completed result be like? How long will it take? What are\nthe keys for success? How much should it cost? How will you verify and incorporate the results?\n\nThese expectations must be written down and given to the person that is to carry out the\ntask. Unspoken expectations are road to disappointment. Special care should be given to new tasks\nthat you have not done before.\n\nBefore you can communicate expectations clearly, you should consider performing the tasks three\ntimes yourself. The first time allows you to decide what you are really looking for. The second time\nlets you write down a pattern that can be followed by another person about the steps that they\nshould follow to achieve the desired results. The third time allows you to verify that the pattern\nactually works. This written pattern is the simplest form of training and will save you a lot of\ntime in discussions with the person doing the work.\n\nThe third aspect of delegation is verifying that the results are acceptable and incorporating them\ninto your organization. This involves acceptance testing and integration. If you have done a good\njob of setting the expectations then you already have a list of the acceptance criteria. This can be\nused as a check list to ensure that all of the desired elements are in place. The results of the\ndelegated task do not produce a benefit until they have been combined with other task to produce the\ndesired business result. When delegating, make sure to plan for how you will benefit from the work\nthat is done.\n", "user": 3, "title": "Secrets of delegation"}}, {"pk": 203, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/MyBook/Public/SuperPower/Learn", "time": "2014-06-15T20:36:33.810", "text": "* Learn *                 -*-muse-*-\n\nLearning is the ability to embrace something new: a concept, an idea, an understanding.

It can also be a humbling experience as well.

By\nfollowing a few simple practices you can put your learning into overdrive.\n\nA learning system should be goal oriented.  At its core you should have tools for setting and\ntracking learning goals.  There are several different time horizons that you will want to work with.\nYou should be activity thinking about what you wish to learn in the next year, the next month, and\nthe next week.\n\nYour system should be simple.  Start with a simple text file.  Any more complicated tool tempts you\nto focus on the format of the information rather than the information itself.  I speak from\nexperience here, having used many different tools like mind-mapping, outliners, word processors and\ngoal setting tools.\n\nShort is better than long. One page is more than enough to capture any set of goals that you have.\nA small amount of planning is productive, but more planning is not.  Your plan should be just\ncomprehensive enough to give you confidence that you are working on the right things.  Any more than\nthat is a waste.\n\nStart with your short term.  What are you learning this week?  Make a list of the things that you\nare actively learning.  Now group these into goals for the next month.  Are there other things that\nyou need to learn this month that are not on this list?\n\nNow focus on the long term.  What would you like to be learning over the next year?  As you do this\nlevel make sure to reconcile what you are doing now with where you would like to be in a year.  When\nyou are done you will have a complete map of where you want to be in a year and how your daily\nactivities can contribute to that.\n\nThe first time that you go through this process you could easily spend an hour or two.  Once you\nhave your initial plan it should take no more than five minutes to review the plan and make any\nminor corrections due to what has changed.  You should review this plan at least once a week.\n\nThere you have it: a simple but robust system to manage your learning, that takes one piece of paper\nand five minutes per week.\n\n\n\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Your Learning System"}}, {"pk": 205, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/MyBook/Public/SuperPower/Chapter7", "time": "2014-06-15T20:36:34.138", "text": "* Chapter 7 - Motivation *                      -*-muse-*-\n\n[[Motivation][Motivation]]\n\n[[Vision][Vision]]\n\n[[ProjectManagement][Project management]]\n\n[[SettingExpectations][Setting expectations]]\n", "user": 3, "title": "Chapter 7 - Motivation"}}, {"pk": 206, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/MyBook/Public/SuperPower/OptimizeEssentialTasks", "time": "2014-06-15T20:36:34.351", "text": "* Optimize Essential Tasks *                 -*-muse-*-\n\nThere are some things that you do many times every day, and these tasks govern your effectiveness.\nThese are either tasks that consume a large chunk of your time, ones that you do many times\nthroughout the day, or tasks that will cause you great remorse if neglected.\n\nThese task (taken together) are your essential tasks.  How you deal with these will largely\ndetermine your personal effectiveness.  It may help to highlight a few essential tasks in each of\nthe three categories.\n\nI am a consultant so each month invoices must be created.  This is not a complicated task but it can\nbe time-consuming.  Because this is recurring and costly it is an essential task for me.  Instead of\nspending time just creating the invoice I try to invest the same amount of time improving the way\nthat I create an invoice.\n\nIf it takes me a thirty minutes to create an invoice then it would be better to invest thirty\nminutes today to let me create an invoice next time in fifteen minutes.\n\nThe rule of thumb is that if you have a recurring job that takes X to do then invest X in trying to\nget the job to cost X/2.  On your second time you will break even.  In our example, it took 60\nminutes (30+30) to create three invoices the old way, and now it takes 60 minutes (30+15+15).  If\nyou do 24 invoices a year you save 5 1/2 hours (15m*24-30m).\n\nYou save the most by improving the tasks that take the largest percentage of your time.  In our\ninvoicing example we were dealing with a task that takes 12 hours in a year.  Consider a task that\nconsumes 40% of your work time.  Now you're talking about a whopping 800 hours every year.  If you\ncould find a way to improve this essential task by 50% then you could save 400 hours every year.\n\nI recommend that you use this type of a simple calculation with your most essential tasks.  These\nare the ones that when gathered represent the bulk of your time investment.  In the previous example\nif you could get a gain of 400 hours in a year then it would be worth investing up to 400 hours to\nachieve it.

This person is\ninterested in the exact same subjects that I am but may not be exposed\nto the same media.\n\nSome information is worth passing on, but much is not.  When you find\na gem add it to your reading list.  If you find a great blog book mark\nit.  If you discover a book that gives you key insights then put it on\na list.\n\nNext, find other sources of information that are connected to what you\nfound interesting.  Does this book or blog reference others?  Are\nthere a group of people that always write about interesting things?\n\nInformation is connected together in pools.  Once you find a\nrepository that you like then you have discovered and source of future\nenjoyment.  A author that you enjoy is very likely to produce other\nworks that you will also enjoy.  This is something that you must\nexploit to maximize your learning.\n\nThe flip side of this is also true.  Avoid information that does not\nring your bell.

When\nyou have what you need, what will you do to give your life meaning?\nHow can you move beyond success to significance.\n\nThe book wrestles with these issues and has some fairly radical ideas.\nThe primary theme is that you will only be fulfilled when you learn\nhow to serve others.  Then the primary question is how to best make a\ndifference with the resources and opportunity that you have.  No easy\nanswers, but some great questions to grapple with.\n\n**Getting Things Done**\n by David Allen\n\nOne common source of stress that all of us face is based on the\npressures to take care of the myriad of details that make up our\nlife. This is compounded by not having a system that we can fully\ntrust that reminds us of what needs to be done. David Allen outlines a\nsystem that significantly reduces our overall stress by capturing and\norganizing everything that needs to get done.\n\nThis book is a huge benefit to anyone that juggles many priorities at\nwork and home. You can build a simple and personalized system that\nmanages all of your appointments, tasks, reminders, and new\ninformation that you want to track. A system replaces trying to\nremember what needs to happen next.\n\n**7 Habits of Highly Effective People**  \n by Stephen Covey\n\nThis classic book is on becoming a more effective person. Stephen\nCovey defined effectiveness as the ability to get things done as well\nand building relationships. \n\nFocusing on the long-term impact of everything you do lets you\naccomplish your short-term goals without sacrificing future\nopportunities. Win at both the tasks and relationships with others.\n\nThis allows more productive activities in the future. The primary\ntheme is that if you want to become more effective, you must devote\nenergy to working on your character.\n\nThis book is a must-read for everyone. Many of the principles are very\nwidely discussed within modern work environments.  But it is worth\ngoing to the source to get the complete picture.\n\n**Four-Hour Work Week** \n by Timothy Ferris\n\nOne of the most intriguing books I have read in a while is by Tim\nFerris, called the \"4-hour Work Week\".  It covers to the topic of not\njust working less, but more importantly, getting a lot more from life.\n\nThe fundamental premise of the book is that you can achieve greater\nresults and work less.  This is the result of focusing on the few things\nthat actually produce the best results for us.\n\nHe outlines specific tactics for how to eliminate the waste that takes\nover most of our days.  After we have pruned off all but the essential\ntasks then it is time to automate.  This allows the remaining tasks to\nbe completed with the smallest amount of invested time.\n\nWe then use this newfound productivity to create new goals that are\nbased on life dreams.  For Tim a lot of these goals involve travel.\nHe uses the flexibility of being able to work from anywhere in the\nworld to create a lifestyle where he does.\n\nAs you read the \"4-hour Work Week\" you will stumble upon some real\ninsights that will change how you perceive your work life.  This will\ncause you to change part of how you do work.  The book must be\nadjusted for your work context rather than applied directly.  But\nthis effort will certainly pay off for you.\n\n**Now, Discover Your Strengths**  \n by Marcus Buckingham\n\nEveryone has a super-power. We are are created in such a way that we\nare predisposed to excel in certain areas. These are our\nstrengths. Unfortunately, the research has shown that the vast\nmajority of people do not operate primarily in there areas of\nstrength. They slog it out day after day in jobs they hate doing\nthings they are no good at.\n\nThis book outlines a process for defining your strengths based upon\nyour ingrained talents. Once you are aware of these talents you can\nfully develop them into strengths. This book is a game-changer for\nmany people.\n\n\n**Switch** \n by Chip and Dan Heath\n\nChange is a major part of our lives.  How we deal with change governs\nour effectiveness both personally and in working with others.  This\nbook explores the topic of change in depth.  \n\nIt provides a very simple model to apply to everyday situations that\nwe face.  It presents studies and experiences from quite a broad\nspectrum to illustrate the concepts of change.  \n\nIt is really easy to read and yet every chapter reveals another great\nidea that can be applied immediately.  Reading this book significantly\nincreased my understanding of the process of change.  \n\nThis understanding can be applied to every area of our lives.  This\nbook helped me think about change differently.  It made me realize the\nrole of change both personally and professionally.  \n\nThis book made me commit to changing personal habits and adopting a\nposture of embracing rather than tolerating change.  \n\nOn a professional level it gave me insight and tools to help others\nchange.  Everyone of us wants to make a difference where we work.\nThis book will allow you to be more effective in doing so.\n\n\n**Upgrade Your Life**  \n by Gina Trapani\n\nThis book shows you how to use computers to optimize a myriad of daily\nactivities.

If you have this, you\nimmediately recognize what I'm talking about.  You may find it hard to\nrelax because even your leisure time is filled with structure and\npurpose. \n\nThis attribute is both a character strength and a flaw at the same\ntime. People wired for achievement can accomplish great things since\nthey have a tremendous reservoir of energy for the things that they\nfeel are important.  \n\nThe dark side of this personality trait is that their self-worth is\noften directly tied to what they do. Accomplishing a meaningful\nmilestone produces flood of well-being.  But this has a relatively\nshort half-life. Soon the thrill of past achievements wears off an the\nachiever is out looking for the next fix.\n\nI first realized that I was wired this way when reading Marcus\nBuckingham's book, \"Now, Discover Your Strengths\".  He outlines major\npersonality traits discovered in years of research by the Gallop\nOrganization. He provides a test to measure your top attributes from a\nlist of thirty four.\n\nA profile is given for each of the attributes which includes a\nsnapshot from the persons experience.  An achiever starts every day\nwith a mental list of accomplishment.  Satisfaction is determined by\nwhat you do today.  Yesterday doesn't really count.\n\nI had two reactions to this diagnosis.  At first I was pleased. Of\ncourse we would want to have a greater motivation to succeed than my\ncolleagues. This is the wave that has carried my crowning career\naccomplishments.\n\nMy second reaction came as a response to being doomed to run on the\ntreadmill.  Why can't I just be like a normal person?  Why do I have\nto be doing something useful all of the time?\n\nOver time, I have come to appreciate the different aspects of this\npersonality trait and the ramifications that it has for everything.\nIn this article I want to share these insights with you.\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Learn, Grow, Produce"}}, {"pk": 218, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/MyBook/Public/SuperPower/MakeConstantImprovements", "time": "2014-06-15T20:36:36.456", "text": "* Make constant improvements *                  -*-muse-*-\n\nWhen it comes to changing habits, small consistent changes are far\nbetter than large ones. The reason is simple. A large change is almost\nalways temporary while a small one is sustainable.\n\nRather than trying to change everything thing at once, consider\nembracing an attitude of sustainable change. Adopt a mind-set of\nanalysis and constantly apply minor improvements. Apply changes one at\na time.\n\nAny change that you apply should be sustainable for the rest of your\nlife. Consider carefully one minor tweak and then fully adopt it into\nyour life before you choose the next one. Build incrementally on what\nis already effective in your life.\n\nYou will need to develop four essential competencies. These are the\nabilities to Learn, Plan, Invent, and Teach. In this series of\narticles you will learn to apply these capabilities to build a system\nof constant innovation for your organization.\n\nThe whole process of innovation begins with Learning. This includes\nthe ability to analyze the problem, understand all the key\nconstraints, and identify possible solutions. In future articles we\nwill explore each of these key aspects in detail. For now, think about\na problem area that you need to improve. Jot down a few ideas related\nto these three aspects: Analysis, Constraints, and Solutions.\n\nNow we are ready to proceed to the Planning stage. The three phases of\nplanning are: establish objectives, prioritize the possible solutions,\nand breakdown the specific tasks for the projects that you intend to\nimplement. The objectives you set will help you to do the cost-benefit\nanalysis that is needed to prioritize between alternatives. The\ntactical planning is usually the simplest planning step.\n\nThe Inventing stage is when you apply the solution you created and\nmeasure the results. It is critical to set up the change as a\ncontrolled experiment to confirm what you thought would happen. These\nchanges should always be applied incrementally to guarantee that you\nare producing the desired result from your change. Implement only one\nchange at a time, and reject changes that do not produce the benefit\nthat you expected.\n\nTeaching is about standardizing the result. You should create a new\nscript for the improved process. This change must be communicated to\neveryone that is affected by it. This won't happen automatically. The\nchange should also be applied in a slightly different context to see\nif it holds up well there too.\n\nThis all sounds very simple, and it actually is. The process of\nimprovement is very straightforward. Most people don't do it because\nthinking through each of these steps can be difficult. Having a\nstructure makes it easier to progress through each of the steps and\nachieve the results that you need. Try this on one nasty problem and\nsee if you agree.\n\nImprovement is about change and looking critically at what works and\nwhat doesn't. It may require breaking new ground and trying something\nthat no one has ever tried. But it may also be adopting a best\npractice that you have seen applied in a different context. Driving\nimprovement takes a certain mind-set. It requires that we ask, 'How can\nthis be better?', 'What would I really like from this process?'. It\nrequires an attitude of optimism and the ability to see the potential\nbeyond the current reality.\n\nAn innovative mind-set will help you to overcome the inevitable\nresistance that you will encounter as you begin to change\nthings. Think about what must change in your environment. What things\ncould use improvement? What would bring you the greatest benefit? What\nwould be best case scenario look like? What obstacles must be overcome\nto get to that new potential? These are the questions that a true\ninnovator asks.\n\nThe clarity of the answers will allow you to share your vision of the\nnew future with those around you. Great changes always involve\nothers. By having a firm understanding of where you need to go, you\ncan build a team of people to help you get there.\n\nBegin looking at your life through the eyes of possibility. What would\nthe ideal look like? You may not be that far off. Use the 80/20 rule,\nwhich says that 20% of the effort may get you 80% of the desired\nbenefit. In other words, focus on a few high-impact areas for\nimprovement, rather than trying to change everything. Pick the single\nlargest improvement and create a different there.\n", "user": 3, "title": "Make constant improvements"}}, {"pk": 219, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/MyBook/Public/SuperPower/SettingExpectations", "time": "2014-06-15T20:36:36.632", "text": "* Setting expectations *                 -*-muse-*-\n\n\n\n\nThis is where the projects are won or lost.

Some tend\nto over-plan everything, while others tend to reject all planning.\nThe true value of planning is not in the resulting plan, but the\nprocess of thinking through the issues.\n\n\n\nWhen you plan, try to create the simplest possible plan that will\nwork.  This will be your most effective path forward.  If you are\ngoing to the grocery store the plan that will work will be a list of\nitems to purchase.

Your\nplanning should match the complexity of the problem that you are\ntrying to solve.  My experience shows that many large projects are\nover-planned, meaning that the plan for the project is much more\ncomplex than it needs to be.\n\n\n\nYour first job in planning is to figure out the appropriate scope of\nyour project and match the scope of the plan to its complexity.

Many people see through a lens of 'Scarcity'. This produces a\nfeeling that there is a limited amount of resources that must be\nshared by everyone. If someone else gets a bigger piece of the pie, I\nwill get a smaller one. This attitude is based upon the assumption of\nfixed resources.\n\nWhat if the resources were not fixed but unlimited? How would that\naffect our perception? When we see the world through a lens of\n'Abundance', we open ourselves to the opportunities that surround\nus. If we believe that the pie is of an adjustable size, then we begin\nto explore how we can make the pie bigger. If we are able to enlarge\nthe pie, we all benefit.\n\nEvery business and organization competes in some way for customers,\nmembers, or awareness. This is often viewed as a competition for fixed\nresources: 'If I get more someone else must get less.' Many of these\nsituations, however, allow us to find opportunities that allow\neveryone to come out better. This attitude of abundance allows us to\npursue cooperation over competition.\n\nIs your organization really at odds with every other organization in\nthe world, or are there ways that you share common goals and interests\nwith others? Try to identify these common points of connection and\nfind ways to establish alliances that let you both succeed. Two\norganizations that are aligned on a common goal can be much more\neffective than both of them working independently.\n\nA word of caution must be added to this message: the relationship will\nwork well only if you are in agreement about the goal. If you do not\nhave agreement on the desired outcome, the coordination may fail. You\nmay find yourselves working at cross-purposes.\n\nYou must also be careful to allow time for the relationship to\ndevelop. Do not expect marriage on the first date. Select a project of\nmutual interest and see how that develops before making a larger\ncommitment to each other.\n\nMy experience working with many organizations over the years is that\nnot enough of them think about how to work with others.

We each want to do something of\nlasting value. Every one of us would like to help others improve their\nlives in some way. Otherwise, we would stay in bed all day and watch\nold TV reruns.\n\nBut this burning desire to produce value often leaves people feeling\nfrustrated. They want to benefit others but don't seem to find the\nopportunities that they need to do so. This is where you, as a leader,\ncan step in and help them. You can define ways for people to\ncontribute to some purpose that is beyond themselves.\n\nIn fact, the process of defining opportunities for others will lead\nyou on a personal journey of your own. By looking for ways to 'give\nback' to your community, you will become aware of opportunities that\nhave been missing for years.\n\nThere is something extremely beneficial and fulfilling about trying to\nhelp others. It gives purpose and meaning to everything that we\ndo. This is an area that represents a significant part of each of our\nlives. People that can not see beyond their own needs become\nincreasingly in-grown and self-centered. It is also difficult for\nthese people to have any sort of meaningful relationships.\n\nSome leaders are already committed to so many projects and causes that\ngathering more commitments would be harmful rather than beneficial. If\nyou are one of these leaders, I encourage you to begin thinking about\nhow you can get others excited about helping you. Instead of\nincreasing your commitment level you can try to increase the\ncommitment of others you know.\n\nCan you think of a project that you are involved in currently? Are\nthere too few people to help and too much work to accomplish? Who do\nyou know that could benefit from this opportunity to serve? Select\npeople who are under-committed today. Don't choose the overworked\nrowers that are already in your boat.\n\nThink about this new opportunity from the perspective of the potential\nserver. Is it a good opportunity for them? Do they bring strengths and\npassions that are well suited to the project? If so, then this is a\nproject that could be very meaningful to them. Don't be apologetic\nabout asking for their help.

This is a tragedy since much of our happiness is\ndependent on exercising our strengths.  There is an excellent book by\nMarcus Buckingham, called \"Now, Discover Your Strengths\".  This book\nwill help you to identify areas of excellence. It will give you some\nvaluable guidance in how to spend more time doing what you are well\nsuited for.\n\n\n\nRemember a time when you were so engaged in what you were doing that\nyou completely lost track of time.  You were consumed with your\nactivity.  You were totally engrossed in the moment.  These golden\nmoments reveal what you are passionate about.  What if you could spend\ntwice the amount of time in this type of activity.\n\n\n\nLook for opportunities to do what you love.  Being passionate about\nsomething is a great indicator of a strength.  Understand the specific\nsituation that really lights your fire and look for similar activities\nthat you can participate in.\n\n\n\nOther activities simply drain the life right out of you.  These are\nweaknesses, and are the opposite of strengths.  Rather than giving you\nexcitement and passion they drain those things away.  Consciously\navoid these areas of weakness and attempt to shift time from\nactivities that weaken you areas where you are already strong.\n\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Understand your strengths"}}, {"pk": 226, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/MyBook/Public/SuperPower/BuildSupportSystems", "time": "2014-06-15T20:36:37.879", "text": "* Build Support Systems *                 -*-muse-*-\n\nIf you use computers all day long as a part of your job, you need to\nthink about how you use them strategically.  Most people can save at\nleast 30% of their time spent on the computer.  If you spend 30 hours\nor more a week you can expect to save around ten hours each week by\nbeing clever about your computer tasks.\n\nThis guide will show you the steps that you should take to gain this\nsavings.  Of course you will need to spend some time up front to setup\nyour tools.  But the one-time investment will continue paying\ndividends for years to come.\n\nThe first step is to adopt a viewpoint of solving problems in a more\ngeneral way.  When you encounter a task that you commonly do, think\nabout what kind of tool would let you side-step this problem in the\nfuture.  This mind set will serve you in almost any situation.  You\ncan see repetitive tasks a areas where your process must be improved.\n\nWe will look at implementing this approach in four different essential areas:\n\n * information system\n * learning system\n * planning system\n * communication system\n\nWe will be looking at each of these key systems and walking through\nthe process of understanding the core needs and building tools that\nhelp you work at peak efficiency.  Along the way we will explore some\ngeneral principles that we help you improve your work style and\nspecific trade-offs that are unique to each of these systems.\n\nLet's start with an overview of each of these key systems that we all\nuse and discuss the overall approach to improve them.\n\nYour information system deals with how you manage knowledge.\nComputers are great tools to manage information, but like any tool\nthey require some skill and training to get them to work properly.\nSometimes computers can be a necessary evil that we tolerate only\nbecause we need them so badly.\n\nYour computer can actually be a huge point of leverage when dealing\nwith information.  This guide will show you how to setup an\ninformation system that work much more efficiently that a hodge-podge\ncollection of less efficient systems.  The goal is to have all of your\nknowledge accessible from a single system that has many smaller pieces\nthat work together.  When your system is working you should be able to\nlocate any information that you have within seconds, not minutes.  You\nshould also be able to guarantee that no disaster will destroy your\ndata.\n\nLearning is an important part of any job that dealing with knowledge.\nWe expand our usefulness by learning new skills and capabilities.  You\nneed a system that will support your learning activities and allow you\nto track your progress.  You need an easy and instantly accessible\nsystem to capture ideas for new books, articles, internet sites, etc..\n\nThis guide will show you how to start with a very simple system and\nexpand it as your needs grow.  Many people don't know where to start\nin establishing their learning goals.  We will walk though that as\nwell.\n\nYour planning system is how you keep your activities on track.\nEverybody has a system that they use.  You can have a very effective\npersonal planning system that is still very simple.  In fact the most\neffective system must be simple.  Otherwise, it will fall into disuse.\nA system that doesn't work is worse than no system at all.\n\nYour communication system deals with how you interact with others and\nthe tools that you use to communicate.  Twenty years ago the primary\ntool was the telephone, ten year ago email.  This year it also\ncontains a collection of social networking and messaging tools.\n\nYou need to make sense of these new tools in order to stay competitive\nin today's world.  At the same time these new tools can ruin your\neffectiveness if they become a constant distraction and interruption.\nWe will talk about methods for controlling the level of connectedness\nthat you need to be most effective.  In the modern world, it is\nessential that you control your level of access to others.  If not you\nwill be buried in a sea of over-communication.\n\nA tool gives you leverage.  It multiplies your efforts.  Selecting and\ncreating the right tools can make you many times more efficient than\nyou would be without them.\n\nSo why don't people pay more attention to tools?  The answer is\nusually simple.  You are too busy doing the task today.  You don't\nhave the time or the energy to invest in setting up a tool that will\nsave you effort tomorrow.\n\nThis can be a self-perpetuating reality.  We feel that were are\nrunning behind so we attempt to run harder until we drop from\nexhaustion.\n\nAnother alternative is to view every task as an opportunity to set up\na better way.  When you approach your work with a mind-set of\nimprovement you see the many opportunities for improvement.\n\nPeople that build tools get more done.  Commit 20% of your time\nimproving how you do things.  No matter what the specific details are\nin your job, there is opportunity for refining how you go about your\nwork.\n\nIf you aren't currently spending any time improving how you work then\nyou should probably start by committing to 10%.  You will find that\neach improvement that you make lowers your stress and gives you more\ntime to work on important tasks.\n\nBuild your own personal productivity platform! Some people are a lot\nmore effective at getting things done because they employ a personal\nproductivity platform. This gives them the technology for\naccomplishing and tracking things in real-time. You can set up your\nown, by giving some consideration to the following areas:\n\n**Task management** - How do you track your upcoming appointments? How\ndo you track all of the open projects with reminders about what needs\nto be done next?\n\n**Communication management** - How do you stay in contact with people?\nHow can you be more systematic and efficient about electronic\ncommunication?\n\n**Information management** - How can you guarantee that your data will\nnot be lost (either through an accident, or by not being able to find\nit in a timely way).\n\nWhen you have solid answers to each of these questions you have\ncreated an effective personal productivity platform.\n", "user": 3, "title": "Build Support Systems"}}, {"pk": 227, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/MyBook/Public/SuperPower/Chapter2", "time": "2014-06-15T20:36:38.079", "text": "* Chapter 2 - Plan Your Approach *                      -*-muse-*-\n\n[[CraftYourPlans][Craft Your Plans]]\n\n[[Projects][Projects]]\n\n[[Actions][Actions]]\n\n[[JustEnoughPlanning][Just enough planning]]\n\n[[Roles][Roles]]\n\n[[UpdateYourPlan][Update your plan]]\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Chapter 2 - Plan Your Approach"}}, {"pk": 228, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/MyBook/Public/SuperPower/Expectations", "time": "2014-06-15T20:36:38.296", "text": "* Expectations *                 -*-muse-*-\n\nPeople often expect you to read their minds.  This can be a dangerous situation when expectations\nare involved.  Put effort into understanding the expectations of others.  Avoid those rude awakenings.\n\nVerify that expectations are shared.  Ask others what they expect.  You might be surprised by the\nanswer.  When you hear someone else describe what you believe should happen, then you are much\ncloser to agreement than when you state your own assumptions and ask for agreement.\n\nPay close attention to any nuance that you did not expect to hear.  For example, \"That design will\nbe complete on Tuesday, except for the rubilator\", is their way of telling you that the rubilator is\nnot included.  On the other hand, if you asked, \"Will the design be done next Tuesday?\", you would\nlikely not learn this additional information.\n", "user": 3, "title": "Expectations"}}, {"pk": 229, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/MyBook/Public/SuperPower/Projects", "time": "2014-06-15T20:36:38.473", "text": "* Reduce Stress by Doing Less *                 -*-muse-*-\n\nReduce your stress by doing fewer things.  You are probably juggling many different projects,\nwhether you have them listed or not. Clarifying your active projects will greatly reduce your\nstress.  Understanding all of your activities gives you a chance to prioritize them.\n\nSome of your projects are not essential and may be even a distraction.  Examine your projects and\nprioritize the important ones. Reduce the effort expended on the others.  This will let you put\nmore energy into what really matters.\n\nEach project has some desired goal.  A project is just a series of tasks that result in the goal.\nSome project be accomplished in a single action, but most often require several actions to complete.\nYou need to track all of your active projects, to make sure that you stay on course.\n\nMake a list of all of the things that are on your mind.  Writing them down gives you confidence that\nyou will not lose track of them.  Scan this list periodically to recall the things that you need to\nbe working on. Write a single list so that you can find all of your projects in one place.  This\nlets you quickly review everything at once.  Having multiple lists creates confustion.\n\nCreate another list of projects that you are not actively committed to spend time on.  Keep from\nforgetting totally about these other goals by putting them on the \"Someday\" list.  It moves them\nout of the way.  You do not need to worry about all of these items as you do your active projects.\nMost people have about 20-30 active projects at any time.  There may be 50 more things that\nyou would like to do someday. Don't let these items take any of your daily attention.\n\nThe list of active projects should be updated daily.  As new projects are discovered then just\nadd them to the list.  Pick a name that represents the goal of the project. Remove things from the\nproject list when you no longer feel that the project needs your active attention.

Then they change some more.  Change is constant.  You\nneed planning methods that recognize this.  Large projects need even\nmore flexibility, while maintaining the ability to coordinate all of\nthe different dependencies.\n\n\n\nYou should review your plans weekly to keep them fresh.  If you need\nto coordinate between multiple people, departments, and companies,\nthen the best way to do this is to identify key deliverables.  Each\ndeliverable represents work that one group needs to provide to another\ngroup on a certain date to keep the project on track.\n\n\n\nThese dates should not move around much since this can cause a great\ndeal of pain.

While it is true that people with positions of authority\nare almost always leaders, it is also possible to demonstrate\nleadership without a title. Leadership is primarily about influence,\nand you can be a person of influence wherever you are.\n\nPeople in positions of authority have a special need to influence\nothers. Trust is the most important ingredient in creating\ninfluence. Leaders who have not gained the trust of others will lack\ninfluence and will exhibit poor leadership. Remember, people will\nalways follow someone they trust.\n\nTrust is earned over a period of time, and it is impossible to force\nsomeone to trust you. As a result, influence cannot be extracted\nmerely by holding a position of authority. Therefore, leadership is\nsomething that a person grows into by making decisions that are\nbeneficial to others.\n\nOnce others realize that you truly desire to help them, you will have\ninfluence in their lives. There is no shortcut to influence. You may\nbe able to force obedience for a while, but you cannot force\ninfluence.\n\nAs we begin to understand that leadership is tied to influence we\nrealize that anyone can lead. The true leaders in any group are the\nones that people listen to and follow. This is not always the person\nat the top of the hierarchy.\n\nPositional authority is typically awarded to recognize increased\nleadership. The position recognizes, but does not create,\nleadership. In most cases, leadership is learned and earned.\n\nYou can begin acting today in a way that demonstrates to others that\nyou care for their welfare.

Having a\nclear understanding of the future risks and opportunities is a vital\npart of the leaders job.\n\nAre you clearly communicating what you believe to others? Others\naround you should resonate with the message that you present.  Teach\nthem about both opportunities and risks to create a shared\nunderstanding. \n\nAsk for feedback to help create a common viewpoint on what is\npossible.

It is impossible to make large sacrifices when you cannot\nclearly see what will be gained by it.\n\nAny leader that is wanting the full engagement of their team must\nstart by laying out a vision of the future.

Many people will claim that they have too\nmuch work to do.  They are unable to do the things they value because there is a large bucket full\nof items needing attention.  This thinking is based on a faulty assumption.\n\nMany believe that the current tasks are like a bucket.  Emptying the bucket will produce a state of\ntranquility and peace.  The reality is that the bucket refills itself automatically.  Let's look at\nwhy this is the case.\n\nThe bucket represents our desire to accomplish certain goals.  We plan goals assuming everything\nworking in our favor.  In the perfect world, you can accomplish certain tasks over the next week.\nUnfortunately, we don't live in a perfect world. \n\nTwo things are working against us. First, the expectations of others creep into our plans.\nAdditional unplanned tasks are added to our own desires and goals.  We originally set our plans to\naccomplish what we thought should be done.  Later we must adjust our plans to make room for new\ndemands.\n\nSecond, our expectations are always optimistic. As we do a task we learn more about it.  Our\nexpectation was based on full understanding, but we find that we only had a partial understanding\ninitially.  Typical tasks may easily require three times the amount of time that we originally\nexpected.  As we work on each task we get distracted and this causes further delays.\n\nSo what is the solution?  Do we create a firewall that prevents distractions and responding to the\nneeds of others?  A far better solution is to adjust our own expectations.  We realize that work is\na stream; it constantly replenishes itself.  As tasks are removed from the queue, new ones are\nadded.  You never get done; you only make progress.\n\nOur focus should be on the results that we do achieve, rather than the items left in the stream.\nEach task that we work on should be the most important and urgent task that we can work on at the\ntime.

No matter which camp we find\nourselves in, we need the input and insight that other people have to\noffer.\n\n\n\nIt can be easy for us to fool ourselves into thinking that we have a\ngreat idea, but once we air the idea in public we may find that it\nstill needs more development.

Join the\nclub!  This is the essence of a simple lifestyle.  One of life's\ngreatest mysteries is learning how to live for the things that matter.\n\nCreating a simple lifestyle does not happen automatically.  In fact\nthe opposite is true.  If we let things occur naturally we take on\nmore and more commitments until we are overwhelmed by the expectations\nof others, and our own aspirations.\n\nA simple life requires thought and discipline. It comes from\nsystematically evaluating what is really important.  When you know\nthat you can try to eliminate, or at least reduce, everything else.\nThis is a journey of self-discovery that will produce many benefits\nfor you.\n\nA simple lifestyle is not easy to achieve precisely because it\nrequires a great deal of analysis.  By default many things that we\ndon't value creep into our lives.  They crowd out what really matters.\nThe motivation to simplify comes from a realization that life can\neasily pass us by without ever experiencing the things of most value.\nThis is the source of true regret.\n\nUnderstanding ourselves is the key to simplifying things. Each of us\nhave different gifting and personal characteristics.  There are\nactivities that play to our strengths. When we know the types of\nsituations where our strengths can shine we can consciously look for\nmore of them.  Simplifying our lives include being more selective\nabout activities that we are involved in.\n\nSimplifying is a process.  You don't just wake up one morning and\nnotice that you have a simple lifestyle.  Instead each few days you make\na decision to make a small change.\n\nBecome intentional about the way that you live.  Choose to give\nyour time to the people and activities that you value.  Stubbornly\nrefuse to invest time in activities that do not yield fruit.\n\nHere are some tips to help you in your search of a simpler life.  We\nlive in a world and a time that puts constant pressure on us.  We need\nmore stuff and need to be involved in more things, or so we are told.\nThere comes a time for us to say no to these demands and reshape our\nlives.\n\nCreating a simpler life is primarily about making choices.  Instead of\ntrying to meet all possible goals, we focus on those that we feel most\npassionate about.  Clearly everything is not equally important to us.\nSimplifying means being more selective about how we spend our time and\nour money.\n\nA simple life is one where our time is spend on the things that we\nlove with the people that we love.  In order to maximize the\nactivities that produce the highest benefit we must minimize other\nactivities that are less worthy of the investment.\n\nLikewise, a simple life also involves how we spend our money.  Some\nthings we invest in get us closer to our goals while others do not.\nMany items that we buy do not produce the value that justifies their\ncost.  Money spent requires an investment in time to work to cover the\ncost.\n\nBecause money can be converted into time (and the counterpart), we can\nsee that our handling of both time and money are interlinked.  In\norder to simplify our lives we need to limit the commitments and\npurchases that we make to the essentials.\n\nFind those areas to commit extra resources where the passion is the\nhighest.  The extra investment in those activities will come by\nreducing the low value ones. Selection is the key to simplifying your\nlife.\n\nMake a list of your top five goals.  What would make your life feel\nmore fulfilling?  Are you investing in these areas?  Can you get more\nof this?  Are you willing to reduce the other less fulfilling\nactivities to get more of your top goals?

I\nhave always been fascinated with the way things work. My parents were\nnot always pleased when my curiosity drove me to take things apart to\nfigure out how they worked. Over time though, this has developed into\nan adult-level understanding of invention and productivity. These\nnatural tendencies are now coupled with experience and allow me to\napply my energy to helping other people with technology.\n\nIn college I studied electrical engineering and graduated at the top\nof my class in 1981. After graduation I took a job with\nHewlett-Packard and began designing disk drive controllers. My first\nproject was a gigantic, 400 MB disk drive the size of a washing\nmachine. During the course of my 25 years at HP I had the opportunity\nto design parts of many wonderful products, including: scanners, OCR\nsoftware, web sites, printers, and digital cameras. One of the\ngreatest joys for me is to walk into a store that carries consumer\nelectronics and see all of the many products that I contributed to.\n\nIn 2007 I followed my dream and started a company, called Shrinking\nWorld Solutions. This company would serve the needs of businesses and\nnon-profit organizations. Over the years I have had a lot of\ninteractions with small business owners and non-profit leaders. Almost\nuniversally I see the same issues in play. Small organizations\ndesperately need to utilize technology. However, it is bewildering to\nthe leaders. How do we set it up? How do we keep it running? What if\nit doesn't do what was promised? These concerns are so daunting that\nmost leaders try to ignore technical solutions until they have a\ncrisis.\n\nIn the last five years, we have seen a remarkable transformation in\nthe high-tech industry. The internet has become the focal point for\nvirtually all software. This allows people with nothing more than an\ninternet connection to operate on a level playing field. Large\ncompanies with dedicated IT departments become very similar to a small\nbusiness that relies on remote software to operate.\n\nThe world has truly become a small place. Small businesses can now\nsell products and services globally. The internet opens a new world of\npossibilities for businesses and organizations. Now it is no longer\nnecessary to expend large amounts of capital to reach a global\naudience. This shrinking world phenomenon is at the doorstep of every\nsmall business and non-profit organization.\n\nShrinking World Solutions empowers you to reach the world, by offering\nlow-cost technology and training on how to get the most from it. I\nbelieve in using low-cost tools that already exist, but also have the\ncapability to produce new solutions when needed.

If\nnothing comes to mind, maybe you have been too focused on the tactical\nand not enough on the strategic. It is so easy to get caught up in the\nday-to-day turmoil that we forget to look at the bigger picture.\n\nIt is extremely easy to incorporate the practice of creating daily\nheadlines into your life. Most of us have a few minutes of planning\ntime in the morning as we start our day. Simply pause to ask the\nquestion, 'What did I do yesterday for my headline?' This will quickly\nbring you to the most important thing that you did of lasting value.\n\nThe logical extension of asking what you did, is to ask what you are\nplanning to do today that will be remembered. This practice does not\ntake much time, but it does create an opportunity for introspection\nand adjustment.

It must be\neasy for you to make minor adjustments as you learn new information.\n\n\n\nIf your plan can be adjusted in five minutes then you will not\nhesitate to do so whenever it is needed.  The most crucial planning\ninvolves identifying the top five risks and the best action to lower\nthe risk.

You can\nwrite this on a list in your pocket and review it as you wait in\nline. This is portable, flexible, and yet robust enough to encourage\ndisciplined thinking.\n\n\n\nAs things change you can easily switch priorities on your top five\nrisks.  It is equally easy to decide on a different action for one of\nthe risks.  As new risks are discovered you can integrate them onto\nyour list.

Otherwise you will end up with a list of twenty things which is\nthe same as having no priority at all.\n\n\n\nHow often should the plan be update?  Whenever you have new\ninformation or new ideas then update your plan.  Each time you are\nready to make a different decision then update your plan and think\nabout all of the implications involved.\n\n\n\nConsider these changes as adjustments, rather than create a new plan.\nYou are refining your thinking based on your best knowledge at the\ntime.  Don't lock yourself into old ideas that no longer are optimal.\nThe changes are minor tweaks in a consistent overall direction.\n\n\n\nBy making small but constant changes you are always ready to respond\nto the next change in your project.

You can only do a series of\nspecific actions that will advance the project toward its goals.\nProcrastination is typically a result of the indecision that results\nfrom the overwhelming number of choices for what to do.\n\nYou break this deadlock by decomposing a large project into a series\nof smaller projects.  This about your project as an outline of\nprojects.  At each level completing the project is a matter of\ncompleting each of the projects underneath of it.\n\nThe project plan is nothing more than the mapping of the projects into\nsub-projects.  Two important questions emerge: How many sub-projects\nshould be under each of the projects?  How deep should the planning\nprocess go?\n\nThe value of any list decreases with the length.  A flat list of the\nhundred things that you need to do has little value and will overwhelm\nyou.  A good rule of thumb is to start with three things that must be\ndone and allow it to grow as the problem dictates.\n\nDon't use any more than seven projects under one project. Use nesting\nto capture the additional detail. This will also force you to balance\nthe sub-projects relative to each other.  For example, when writing a\nbook you would not plan it out as \"Think about title\", \"Write and\npublish all content\".  Pick sub-projects that are roughly equal is\nsize and scope.\n\nThe depth that you do when planning is an important choice that you\nmake.  Choose a depth that allows you to accurately see the scope of\nyour project.  Use past experience to determine how to breakdown the\nfirst few levels.

It requires taking the time to appreciate the\nworld around us.  Ask question about why things are the way they are\nand you will find some surprising answers.\n\nOther learning requires planning and diligence on your part.

For example, if you are interested in\ncreating websites, joining a website design group will cause you to\nlearn things that you did not specifically set out to learn.\n\nThe power of an online community is much like the benefit of belonging\nto a community 'in the real world'. We share experiences, hopes,\ndreams and fears with one another.

The benefit of the internet is that your community can\nbe composed of people all over the world.

Already today, you have\nbeen thinking about actions that you need to do and projects with\nloose ends that need attending.  You have probably also been thinking\nabout the roles that you play and dreams and fears of the future.\nYour planning needs to embrace all of the different ideas.\n\n\n\nPlanning is simply decision making about the future.

The values are what you desire most out of life.

This will help to focus your attention on what really matters.\n\n\n\nYou can also look at where you spend your time and money.  Is there a\ngap between these two views?  If so then it will be the source of a\nlot of emotional discord.  If you treasure vacation, but haven't taken\none in twelve years then you are in trouble.  Time to begin planning\nyour vacation.  If you value education, but never got your high school\ndegree then you are certain to be in turmoil.\n\n\n\nBefore you can do effective short-term planning it is important to do\nthis self-assessment.

Anywhere you go is a change in context.  You are likely\nto get new ideas.  The farther you go the bigger the adventure.  You\nwill see new places, eat new foods, hear new languages, experience new\nbathroom facilities, and meet new people.\n\nYou will love it and you will hate it.  But you will be truly alive.\n\nTraveling to other places breaks our daily habits and routines.  This\ncan open our eyes to new people and places if we allow it.

There is excitement as you\nanticipate, exhilaration as you participate, and deep satisfaction as\nyou reflect.\n\n\n\nThese activities are innately life-giving because they are custom\nsuited to you, a perfect match for your personal characteristics.

It is\ndescribed in detail in his book, Getting Things Done.  The system that\nhe outlines is really a set of guiding principles.  He avoids locking\nthe system into a specific implementation.\n\nAn entire cottage industry has risen up to provide software and ideas for implementing a Getting\nThings Done (GTD) system.  TO get a list of various software packages that you could use to setup\nyour own system just type \"GTD software\" into Google.  You will get many different software\nsolutions to fit every shape and size.\n\nCreate a simple system!  I've used a number of the software solutions for GTD. After spending\nseveral week setting the system up the way that I want it always seems to end at the same point. I\ncan make the system do what I want but it requires a lot of mental energy to work the system. I need\na system that requires almost no thought expect the tasks themselves. The system must be transparent\nand allow me to focus on the actual planning rather than the planning tool.\n\nHere is the system that works for me. Use a text editor to create five text files. Set up a command\nor window short-cut that opens all five of the text files. A tabbed text editor works great for\nthis. You can also open each of the files separately off of window short-cuts, but you must be able\nto open any of these files with a single click.\n\nThe five files that I use are:\n\n  * Calendar - List of events sorted by date\n  * Home - List of next actions that I plan to do today (typically\n    around ten items) \n  * Work - List of next action that I plan for today (typically ten items)\n  * Projects - List of things to work on this week (typically around\n    20-30 items grouped by categories)\n  * Someday - List of things that I would like to work on someday\n\nAll day long these files are updated. Resist the temptation to add\nstructure to these. It is easy to get distracted by reorganizing the\nlist. Sort the action lists with the most urgent items at the top.\n\nI have been following the work of David Allen, the author of \"Getting Things Done\" for several years\nnow. He has the most instructive system for managing your life. Here is a summary of how you can\napply his ideas to build your own personal task management system.\n\nMake a simple list of the next action that should be taken in each area where you need to accomplish\nsomething. Create another list of the projects that you are currently working on. In this context a\nproject is any goal that requires more than one action to achieve. It is crucial to make the next\nactions very specific. They must be tasks that can be accomplished in less than an hour.\n\nAs you have time to work on your list, select a suitable task from your next action list. When\ncompleted you may have a new action to add to the list. As things pop up you can add them to your\naction list or the project list, if they require more than an hour.\n\nOnce a week make sure that you review the project list and that you have at least one next action\nfor each of your active projects. All you need to build a minimal task management system is a pad of\npaper where you keep the two lists for your actions and projects.\n\n\n\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Your Planning System"}}, {"pk": 271, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/MyBook/Public/SuperPower/TheNeedForInnovation", "time": "2014-06-15T20:36:46.279", "text": "* The Need For Innovation *  -*-muse-*- \n\nEveryone needs to grow and improve. To stop growing means beginning to die. Growth can come in many\ndifferent forms, but a commitment to learning and improving is absolutely essential. What is true at\nthe personal level is also of organizations.\n\nEvery business or non-profit organization exists to produce value for its members, customers, share\nholders, or those it serves. Growth means producing increasing levels of value over time.\n\nTo accomplish this, you must establish practices that are both effective and\nefficient. Effectiveness is doing the right things so that the desired benefits are actually\nrealized. Efficiency is doing things right to minimize the cost. It is possible for an organization\nto achieve one of these objectives without the other, but both are necessary to produce the results\nat a reasonable cost.\n\nIn order to constantly improve effectiveness and efficiency an organization must commit to a pattern\nof constant innovation. It needs to examine what it is doing and how it is doing it. This\nexamination uncovers gaps between what actually is and what should be. Innovation happens when we\nclose this gap.\n\nThe first step in creating a cycle of constant innovation is to make a commitment to seeing it\nthrough.  Choosing to embark on a journey of continuous improvement means that you will be learning\nwhat is needed to take your organization to the next level.\n\nWe will be looking at the pieces of the innovation cycle: Learn, Plan, Invent, and Teach.  This\nintegrated approach will be applied incrementally and continuously to produce the results you need.\n\nIn the next few articles I will show you how to create a constant innovation cycle that will allow\nyour organization to continuously grow.

But what is a role?  Think of a role as a long-term\n commitment that you made to pursue a set of goals.\n\nYou may have taken on the role of lover, father, employee, or accountant at your comic book\nstore. Each of these roles comes with a set of goals and expectations.  Some of the expectations may\nbe from others, but the important ones are those that you have for yourself.  Fulfilling a role\nmeans achieving these goals.\n\nWhen you take on a role you are committing to a plan of action.  For example, when you choose to\nrole of lover, you decide that you want to make the associated trade-offs.  As an employee you get\ncertain benefits and take on the goals of your employer.  Each role that we are in constrains our\nactions in exchange for the opportunities it gives.\n\nA role is a choice of some segment of lifestyle.  Some soles you choose willingly and others are\nthrust upon you.  Either way your role will determine your actions.\n\nEach role that you take on will have goals associated with it.  Understanding your roles will help\nyou in planning, which will help you achieve goals and be more effective.\n\nTry this exercise.  It may seem trivial at first, but is harder than you think.  Select a role to\nwork on.  Make a list of concrete goals that you have.  Don't select fuzzy goals like, 'Be a better\nperson', but measurable goals like, 'Do dishes for a week'.\n\nIdentifying real steps you will take to fill that role is a huge step forward.  For each role you\ncan probably identify ten projects.  A project is this context is simply a set of actions with a\nclear goal in mind.  This is what you can focus your effort on to be more effective in that role.\nFulfilling goals is how you fill roles.\n\nHow many roles do you have?  Look at what takes you time.  Most people have around ten roles.  In\nyour work alone you probably have three to five roles.  Charting each of these out gives you a very\nclear picture of your like and your time commitments.\n\nI may seem overwhelming to you at first, that you have a hundred different project going.  But the\nreality is that all of these do not have equal priority.  The next exercise will give you some peace\nof mind.\n\nTake you list of ten roles with ten projects each.  Go through each role and select the top three\nproject goals.  These are the most important things to work on within each role.\n\nNext, identify the top three roles that you wish to focus on in the next month.  You have now\nidentified the nine projects that should rock your world.  Put these goals at center stage and give\nspecial attention to them.\n\nConsider repeating this planning once a month.  There will be a few adjustments to make each time\nyou go through it.  But many of the things on the list will remain the same.\n\nThis type of planning gives you confidence that you are investing in things that you really care\nabout.

Therefore it is important to understand our true values.\n\nPlease note that this can often be different than what we might tell\nsomeone else that we value.  Expressed values are about relationship,\nand the expectations of others.  You may have a different, and\nsometimes contradictory set of values that govern your daily actions.\n\nIf these are not consistent with our expressed values then they are\nhidden because we are ashamed to tell others how we really feel.  This\ncan lead to unhealthy attitudes and interactions with others.  It is\nmuch better to understand and express what you really hold dear to\nthose close to you.

One way to break this cycle of ineffective activity is to\nonly perform tasks that have an immediate customer. The person that\nbenefits could be an external client or an internal client (even\nyourself) that needs you to create something.\n\nIf you only do the minimal work needed to satisfy the 'customer' then\nyou will eliminate any gratuitous activities that don't contribute\ndirectly to the result. Manufacturing organizations have functioned\nlike this for years. Toyota is an excellent example. On their\nmanufacturing lines they only build a car to satisfy a specific\norder. Then they only install a dashboard to contribute, which in term\ngenerates a request for a speedometer assembly, which creates an order\nfor the required parts.\n\nIt is wasteful to work on tasks that produce results only to find that\nthere is not a clear way to use those results because of other missing\npieces in the system. This is where we get the concept of work\nflow.

It is important to start with the\nend in mind and work backwards.\n\nIf the result is clear, then it will be easy to figure out the easiest\nway to achieve it. What is the minimum set of subtasks that will\nachieve the desired result? Then what are the subtasks to required to\nproduce those results? This is a more effective way to plan a project\nto avoid assembling activities that may or may not contribute directly\nto the end goal.\n\nTry to reduce every solution to its essence. Inventing something\nscrutinize it thoroughly to see if half of the remaining parts can be\nremoved. During the invention process don't worry about the complexity\ntoo much. But do not forget this important step before accepting the\nfinal solution.\n\nComplexity is the enemy. If people have to remember to perform a\ncomplicated set of steps then it will never happen. Software\nautomation that requires thousands of lines of code requires a\nphenomenal investment to keep running. The best software to debug is\none command that does exactly what you want. The best manual task is\nthe one that requires zero steps for humans to perform.\n", "user": 3, "title": "Simplify"}}, {"pk": 285, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/MyBook/Public/SuperPower/OpenSource", "time": "2014-06-15T20:36:49.041", "text": "* Open Source *                 -*-muse-*-\n\nOne of the most amazing things has happened over the last few years,\nthe Open Source movement has completely changed the nature of software\nengineering, the high-tech industry, and our society in general. Open\nSource software is created by teams of people working for free. Yes,\nyou read right. People from different companies, nations, and\nprofessions willingly work together to create high-quality\nsoftware. This software is then distributed and supported free of\ncharge.\n\nI first came across Open Source software in the mid-eighties. Richard\nStallman created an organization called the 'Free Software\nFoundation'. This team published a manifesto that was based on the\nidea that software should be owned by everyone, and that it was\nimmoral for companies to hoard this value to themselves. While Stallman\nwas pretty extreme in his views, he created a movement that was to\nchange the world.\n\nMuch of the explosive growth in the internet was caused by the\navailability of free software. Without it, innovation would be much\nmore expensive and the higher development costs would make all\nsoftware many times more expensive than what we see today. This would\nseriously curtail the new applications that anyone can use today.\n\nToday you can get high-quality tools in every possible category,\nincluding all of the most important office applications (including\nword processors, spreadsheets, presentations, databases, graphics\neditors, operating systems, and email). These applications are the\nlifeblood of any business. You cannot run a business without them, and\nthe Open Source versions rival the commercial versions in every\ncategory.\n\nI have outfitted my business, Shrinking World Solutions, using Open\nSource software. To set up a new computer in our company we install a\nstack of about 20 applications. These are all free and give everyone\nin the company the exact same tools and configuration. This software\nconfiguration would cost around $5,000 per computer, but with cheap\nhardware, we can set up a new computer for $300 and two hours of time.\n", "user": 3, "title": "Open Source"}}, {"pk": 286, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/MyBook/Public/SuperPower/JustEnoughPlanning", "time": "2014-06-15T20:36:49.269", "text": "* Just enough planning *                 -*-muse-*-\n\nHow you approach planning can determine your effectiveness. Planning is neither an end in itself\nnor a boring activity that stifles creativity and wastes time.  When properly used planning can\namplify your productivity by reducing rework.\n\nWhy plan at all? At its core planning is simply identifying likely risks and making decisions that\nmitigate their effect.  You want to guarantee some expected outcome so you try to stack the deck in\nyour favor.  Planning is imagining the path that will get to the end goal.\n\nIt is important to separate planning from convincing, although they may occur at the same time.\nConvincing is selling your plan to others in a way that creates \"buy in\".  An excellent way to\ngenerate emotional buy-in for a plan is to involve others in its creation.  However, there are\nseveral aspects of planning itself that are important to understand before combining it with\nconvincing others.\n\nRisk mitigation is the goal of every plan.  If nothing can derail your project then no plan is\nrequired.  You don't need a plan to wash the dishes; you just do it.  On the other hand, you can't\nbuild a software application without a plan.  There are too many unknowns that you must control.\n\nStart your planning by fast-forwarding to a bleak future, in which your project has failed.  What\nwent wrong and how could you have prevented it?  At its core this is all planning is.\n\nWhat are the five greatest risks to your project? Forget about everything else.  If you don't\naddress your top five issues then nothing else matters.  These may change over time.  More on that\nlater.\n\nWhy five?  Humans are very good at storing a small number of items in short-term memory.  You want a\nshort list of thing that can be readily remembered and communicated.\n\nThese top five risks should be written and posted somewhere that is readily visible.  Throughout the\nday you should observe this list at least once an hour.  It provides your emotional motivation for\nyour actions.\n\nWhy not three?  There are many different risks that affect you.  It is important for you to have\nsome peripheral vision.  Risks that appear on the list may quickly become your top issue.  But\nrarely, do that appear out of nowhere.\n\nYou may already be tracking the key issue and you know when it is changing in priority. You need to\nactively monitor and evaluate the relative priority of your top five issues.  Respond to new\ninformation as it become available.\n\nDecide what you will do about each of the top issues.  What action can you take that will\nsignificantly lower the risk?  Sometimes, a single action can have a big impact on a specific risk.\nMore often, there are several actions that are required to more the mountain.\n", "user": 3, "title": "Just enough planning"}}, {"pk": 287, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/MyBook/Public/DjangoHammer/Index", "time": "2014-06-15T20:36:49.464", "text": "* Django Hammer *                                       -*-muse-*-\nTurn-key web site infrastructure\n\nThis open-source project delivers a high-quality commercial grade web site.\nSet up your next site in minutes but customize it until it works exactly like you want.\n\n[[Advantages]]\nGettingStarted\n[[Technology]]\nBasicTricks\nDevelopersWanted\n", "user": 3, "title": "Django Hammer"}}, {"pk": 288, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/MyBook/Public/DjangoHammer/Advantages", "time": "2014-06-15T20:36:49.687", "text": "* Advantages *                                       -*-muse-*-\nFully turn-key ...

Use the best available technologies that are well suited for\n    your specific business problems.\n\n    Use tools that are readily available to solve common problems. Build new tools only\n    when required to solve your unique problem.  A standard tool can often solve a problem\n    with a small fraction of the investment required by custom software.\n\n    Pick tools that are proven to produce better results. We have over 50 years of\n    combined engineering experience that makes us experts at tool selection. \n\n    Key Technologies Used:\n    * Linux\n    * Python\n    * Django\n    * Node JS\n    * Angular JS\n    * Git\n    \n\n**Better Process**\n\n    How you build software dictates the results that you will get.  The software process\n    dictates how you plan, design, implement, test, deploy, and maintain your software.\n\n    Design patterns increase leverage. Use standard solutions to common problem.  Figure\n    out the changing elements and develop standard solutions that can be applied to future\n    problems. \n\n    Create common coding patterns to leverage code resue.  Software can be reused in many\n    ways and all levels.  Define your product development strategy to maximize leverage of\n    the definition, design, libraries, and functions that you develop.\n\n    We use the following processes because they have proven to produce better results.\n    Best practices result in higher quality and lower cost.\n\n    * Frameworks increase leverage\n    * Common problems are already solved\n    * Extensive use of code generation\n    * Completely automatic testing\n    * Flexibility of custom code at the cost of off-the-shelf code\n\n\n**Better Project Management**\n\n    We deliver results weekly! This lets you see the resulting product long before it is\n    done. You define the project scope and priorities.\n\n    Redirect the engineering to match growing understanding of need.  We believe that it\n    is impossible to understand the full product at the beginning of the project.  By\n    building the product you can se and respond to the design throughout the development.\n\n    Traditional software planning defines the product details at the beginning of the\n    project.  Then the development proceeds until the most of the budget is consumed.\n    This is far too late to make meaningful changes.  We beleive that this is a serious\n    mistake that leads to failed projects.\n\n    We will send results to you so that you can see the product as it emerges. This gives\n    you the opportunity to redirect the work to match your priorities.  Do as much (or as\n    little) as you want. This flexible work engagement helps you get exactly what you want.\n\n\n**Full range of services**\n\nWe manage, create, test, and support software development.  Use us as you would your own\nengineering teams.\n\nManage\n\n    understand top business needs\n    prioritize work\n    communicate progress\n    coordinate\n\nCreate\n\n    deliver solutions to top problems\n    develop new tools for future problems\n    leverage systems for efficiency\n    rapid development and incremental deployment\n\nTest\n\n    find defects immediately\n    build automatic tests\n    leverage tools across projects\n    focus coverage on top priorities\n\nSupport\n\n    refactoring of legacy code\n    keep the system running\n    address new bix needs quickly\n    understand operations\n    embrace biz needs\n    training in best practices\n \n\n**Simple Pricing**\n\nChoosing the correct pricing model for your project.

This chapter outline\nthe current technology stack that is used today.\n\n**Technologies**\n * Linux\n * Apache/MySQL\n * Python/Django\n * CSS/HTML\n\n**Django** \nThe most important technology decision for MyBook is the\nselection of the Django web application framework. Django is perfect\nfor these types of applications. It is easy to write shell scripts\nthat write the custom code for the application.\n\nDjango is very flexible in allowing custom code where it is needed\nwhile eliminating any repeated code structures that are common within\nweb applications. In other words it is easy to write a simple program\nthat does nothing and then grow it into a powerful application by\nincrementally adding features.\n\n**Python**\nThe Django application framework is written mostly in the\nPython programming language. Python is a very concise and powerful\nlanguage. Programmers familiar with Python are much more productive\nthan programmers using other languages. There is excellent support for\nboth high and low-level language features.\n\nPython also enjoys some of the fastest execution times for scripting\nlanguages. It is extremely portable and can run across many computer\narchitectures and operating systems.\n\n**MySQL**\nThe MyBook application saves its data in a MySQL\ndatabase. MySQL is an open-sourced implementation of the Structured\nQuery Language (SQL) that drives most databases in use today. It is\navailable free of charge. It is free to use in any way that you see\nfit.\n\nOverall it is the leading choice of developers looking for an\nalternative to the proprietary solutions provided by large\nvendors.

Sit down an describe your ideal life\nsituation of three years from now.  This is not a plan but a target.\nWhat would you life your life to be like in three years?\n\nWhy three years?  It is close enough that it demands immediate\naction. But there is also enough time to accomplish something\nmeaningful. A five year goal may not be very realistic because there\nis a feeling that anything in possible.  A one year goal, on the other\nhand, is so immediate that it is not possible to dream.\n\nThree years is enough time to create meaningful change.  The question\nis, \"What direction do you want the change to be in?\".  This should be\nan expression of your values.  What things drive you at your core?\n\nAt this point in my life I value autonomy, mastery, and purpose.\nThese three core values were first articulated for me in the book\n\"Drive\", by Daniel Pink.  But they have resonated with me for a long time.\n\nA target for my life three years from now, would need to embrace all\nthree of these dimensions. Before describing the ideal situation,\nlet's explore each of these three dimensions.\n\n**Autonomy**\n\nFor much of my life I had to work to meet the expectations of others.\nThis was a natural consequence of having responisbility for the\nwelfare of my family.  Now that they are grown I am able to take on\nmore professional risks.\n\nI have also spent thirty years building technical experience and\nfinancial strength to weather the inevitable turmoil to come.  Life is\nwhat happens when you are busy making other plans.\n\nHaving consistently invested for three decades has put me in a strong\nbargaining position from a career, financial, and relational\nviewpoint.  Now it is time to experience the benefit of that.\n\nI want a life situation that lets me choose what I work on, when I\nwork, and who I work with.  I love thinking about projects and intend\nto work hard on them.  But this must be internally motivated rather\nthan forced by the expectations of others.\n\nI have worked hard to acheive this position, and now I am already in a\nposition to control the terms of by carreer.  The biggest challenge\nfor me is to not sell this freedom for some other benefit.\n\n**Mastery**\n\nI see myself as an inventor, software developer, and author.  From\nchildhood I have been facinated by inventing things.  I love learning\nand teaching others.  My whole adult life has been a quest for\nacheiving mastery of the process of developing software.\n\nOver the last few years, I have been making more time to write.\nReading is a very important part of my life.  I have the largest\npersonal library of anyone I know.  As I learn more I feel compelled\nto pass that knowledge on to others.\n\nOver the last few years I have begun to develop daily practices of\nwriting. I have been learning more about the process of writing and\nhow to tell a good story.  Someday I hope to be a stong writer with a\nfollowing of people who anticipate the next update.\n\nI love computers (except when they break).  Software development is an\nintensely human activity.  It is a chance to create an entire world\ninside of a computer.  I have been very facinated by the mechanics of\nthe process of software creation.  I want to thoroughly understand and\nteach what makes great software.\n\n**Purpose**\n\nI think that purpose is about serving others.  It is about meeting the\nneeds of someone else.  Sure we have to meet our own needs but that is\nnot enough.  We each must have a feeling that we are producing more\nthan we are consuming.\n\nAt the end of my life I must be able to point to my career and see\nthat I contributed much more than I was ever paid.  I must be able to\nlook at the lives of the people that loved me most and realize that\ntheir lives were much fuller for knowing me.\n\nFinally purpose for me is about knowing that I have changed the\nworld. I need to know that things that I have said have been heard,\nand that things that I have done have made a difference.\n\nThis comes to the issue of influence.  Have I led others to a deeper\nunderstanding of truth?  Are others inspired by my example to a\ngreater level of sacrifice?  These are the questions that cause me to\nlay awake at night.\n", "user": 3, "title": "My Perfect Life"}}, {"pk": 332, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/MyBook/Public/MarkSeaman/TechnologyGuide", "time": "2014-06-15T20:36:58.891", "text": "* Technology Guide *                 -*-muse-*-\n\nThis guide gives tips to help people learn how to use technology to\nsolve problems that they face in their everyday lives.

several key aspects of creating an exterior brain that really works.  Consider these\ningredients when you build your own brain system.  Any missing aspects will result in\ndisappointments.\n\nA brain is a system that records knowledge, stores it for a long time, and then gives it back when\nyou need it.  This means that it only works if you can efficiently:\n\n * Record\n * Store\n * Organize\n * Retrieve\n\nEach of these tasks has implications on the ingredients needed to build a great brain.  Your tools\nmust have certain technical capabilities to let you easily save and recall information.\n\nRules for a brain that works:\n\n * You can put data into your brain in five seconds.\n * Every piece of information is recorded once.\n * A flexible structure is constantly evolving.\n * See what changed without remembering it.\n\nEach of these rules is absolutely essential to have a system that works. Some systems make it easy\nadd informaiton but don't allow flexibility for the structure.  Other systems are very good at\nremembering things but are painful to update.\n\nDon't compromise.  Create a system that gives you everything you need. Select only tools that work\nwell.  Never settle for tools that do not address the core usability or technical needs that the job\ndemands.\n\nMany people use tools simply because they are already familiar with them. But consider this... over\nthe next year you will spend at least 2,000 hours at work.  An effective brain can easily save you\n500 hours in the first year alone.  Learning new tools if needed should not cost you more than 100\nhours.  \n\nExpect to invest heavily, but still get a payoff for the effort many times over in the first\nyear. The break-even time for building an exterior brain is probably about six months.   At this\npoint you will have reaped enough benefit that you will have paid off the time that you invested.\n\nAfter this time you will have a robust knowledge tracking system that knows what you have decided to\nput in it. This will be useful to you for years to come.  \n\nBecause you built the system from scratch, you will be able to move it with you onto new tools if\nneeded.  The value you have is in the actual text and links.  These will move very easily between\ndifferent systems that you will use.\n\nThe hard part is knowing how to build the system, so that it meets the demands that you will place\nupon it. We will be walking through each of the steps.  We will exaime how the brain should be\nconstructed and used on a daily basis.\n", "user": 3, "title": "Brain Ingredients"}}, {"pk": 428, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/MyBook/Public/Brain/BrainPerformance", "time": "2014-06-15T20:37:19.849", "text": "* Brain Performance *                 -*-muse-*-\n\nThink seriously about the performanc of your brain.  There is a huge\ndifference between brains that work and ones that don't.  Time your\ntasks and make changes if your goals are met.\n\nI use computers all day long and frequently watch other people do it.\nI am astounded to watch someone flail around for a minute or two\ntrying to find a piece of information.  This can easily total a\ncouple of hours a day for just clicking around and trying to remember\nthings from before.\n\nI definitly don't see the enjoyment in doing this.  I want a system\nthat is ready to accept new items instantly and can produce the info\nthat is needed in a few seconds.  The system must be designed around\nthese performance goals or you will not be able to achieve them.\n\nEssential Goals:\n * 2 seconds - Record an idea\n * 5 seconds - Update existing information\n * 15 seconds - Add new informaition or structure or search for keywords\n * 0 seconds - Backups & version control (fully automatic)\n\nYour system must be able to achieve these results to give you the\nsupport you need.  If it can not then you will find yourself working\naround the system rather than within it.\n\nWhen I work everything is done within my exterior brain.  Occasionally I\nvisit web sites, create documents, write code, watch videos, search\nthe internet. But all of these activities are based in activities\nwithin the brain system.\n\nIf I search for a new programming trick, or a new recipe for quiche,\nthe result is summarized in a paragraph of text for use later.  Why\nwould I want to lose information that I may have spent minutes\naquiring when it only costs me 15 seconds to summarize it.\n\nWhen your system is fast enough you will use it for purposes that you\ncan not even imagine today.  How do these goals work in practical\nterms?  When I get an idea the following command can capture it:\n    idea Write about brain performance\n\nThis is how I capture an idea within 2 seconds when I am sitting at my\nkeyboard.  Otherwise I carry a pad and paper in my pocket to go\nmobile.  This lets me avoid the destraction of using my phone to\ncapture the same idea.\n\nIf you are looking at your information on your computer and want to\nfix a typo, or add a link to the current topic.  This should be a\nsimple matter of: Edit topic, Type changes, Save topic.  If it is that\neasy then you will do these operations 100 times per hour.\n\nImagine having a giant recording of living data that is constantly\nevolving and growing.  No sooner do you get an idea than it is already\ncaptured. Everytime you look at something, it gets edited and refined.\n\nBut where the system really shines, is in the ability to find things.\nIt is great to be able to record everything. However the real goal is\nto be able to retrieve things when you need them.  It is tragic that\nmost people do not make their computer find things for them.  Instead\nmany prefer to scroll through endless file lists, and paragraphs\nlooking for what they remember.\n\nYou can go a long way with simple word searches. A search for\n\"Taxes\" should get you to all related topics.  Because I'm a geek,\nregular expressions are even better.  I can search my whole brain for\ncomplex patterns in several seconds.  The search itself requires less\nthan a second of computer time.  Here's how I use regular expressions\nto search for my tax topics:\n    brain Taxes\n\nHere's how I edit all of my tax topics:\n    brain-edit Taxes\n\nYou can see from these examples that it does not have to be hard.\nSimple problems require simple solutions; more complex problems require\na little more sophisicated solutions.  Never accept complex solutions\nto simple problems because you think that you may face an complex\nproblem later.\n", "user": 3, "title": "Brain Performance"}}, {"pk": 429, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/MyBook/Public/Brain/BrainStorage", "time": "2014-06-15T20:37:20.025", "text": "* Brain Storage *                 -*-muse-*-\n\nWhat should you save in your exterior brain?  And how do you make sure that these things are useful\nto you?  You can have a great tool, but still misuse it.  The following guidelines will help you get\nthe most value from your brain.\n\nYou should plan on moving several types of information to your exterior brain. Just the act of\nmoving these will help you discover new aspects of the knowledge itself.\n\nThe first candidate of information to move is how you manage what you do.  Whether you are well\norganized or struggling to keep track of things this system will help you.  Consider starting with\nthree simple lists.\n\nUse a 'next actions' list to track the items that you are currently working on and hope to complete\nin the next couple of days.  Use a 'project' list to track all of the different commitments that you\nare planning on working on sometime in the next week. A calendar can simply be a list of\nappointments that you need to keep.\n\nThe second major type of information to store in your exterior brain is what you know.  This could\nbe contact info, projects notes, how to do things, information about how computers are configured.\nThis is reference material that you need to record and recall later. Simple notes can be entered and\norganized into collections of info over time.\n\nMost jobs involve writing.  This is often held in directories of highly formatted documents, or in\nemail programs that do not have adequate search capability.  One of the benefits of your exterior\nbrain is that it will be extremely easy to search the content.  Develop a strategy that lets you\nsearch everything that you have ever written.\n\nReading is also a major part of what we do.  Your exterior brain can be used as your own personal\nindex to the internet.  This will not be like anyone elses view because your interests are unique.\nThe power of information these days is that a URL can be used to acces almost anything from any\nwhere.  You brain can be a massive well organized index that ends in thousands of URLs.\n", "user": 3, "title": "Brain Storage"}}, {"pk": 430, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/MyBook/Public/Brain/BrainFreshness", "time": "2014-06-15T20:37:20.204", "text": "* Brain Freshness *                 -*-muse-*-\n\nFor your brain to be useful, you must keep it fresh.  This requires\nconstant care and effort on your part.  Your brain is like so many\nother things in life.  You get out of it what you put into it.\n\nInformation in your physical brain is stored in the corrections between\nthe neurons. Think of an elaborate network with roughly the number of\ninterconnections that the internet has.  Now condense this whole thing\ndown into 3-pound lump of biomass.\n\nOur plans are not so glorious, or presumptive, but the idea of\ninterconnection holds.  It is the connections between the topics in\nyour brain that will hold the greatest value to you.  Each topic has\nrelationships to other topics, which will be modeled explicitly by\nhyperlinks in our system.\n\nAt its core our brain is a personal wiki that can easily be edited to\nprovide new connections.  In fact, the usefulness of your brain is\ndirectly related to how consistently you are modifying the connections\nbetween topics.\n\nThe longer data exists within your system the more irrelevant it\nbecomes. In software, we refer to this phenomena as \"bit rot\". The\nsoftware stays the same while the world around it undergoes constant\nchange. Your information must be constantly reviewed and updated to\nreflect this reality.\n\nThink of the last information that you recorded for projects, goals,\n\"how to\" knowledge, and great ideas.  Now scrutinize these with eyes\nfrom your wiser future self (1 year from now).  Is it still brilliant?\nMaybe so, but it would be even better if you keep it up to date.  More\nlikely it should be deleted or relegated to the lower dungeon.\n\nEach topic has its own half-life.  All data does not age at the same\npace.  Consider building this into your brain directly.  One way to do\nthis is to have a topic that is a simple list of notes and update\ntimes.\n\nEach time horizon could could have its own list (Weekly, Monthly,\nQuarterly, Yearly).  Add the topic to the list with its modification\ndate and visit this list periodically to find items whose expiration\ndate has expired.\n\nI perfer to do this with a tool, since I am a programmer.  I add a\nWeekly tag to my topic and my search tool gives me a list of the\noldest topics that has expired.  Either way, keep the process simple,\nbut do it regularly.\n\nDuring this review, update the content of the information.  But the\ncontext of the info is even more important.  Update the connections,\nadd new connections.  Sometimes the topic grouping has evolved so much\nthat it warrants its own index.\n\nHave fun.  Leave your future-self reminders and interesting morsels to\nfind. The tricky thing about your inner brain is how it remembers\nthings through it own emotional filter.  Reviewing content from your\nexterior brain can be a different experience.  You see exactly what you\nrecorded in remarkable fidelity and get a chance to extend it or fix\nit to make sense for today.\n", "user": 3, "title": "Brain Freshness"}}, {"pk": 431, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/MyBook/Public/Brain/Headlines", "time": "2014-06-15T20:37:20.373", "text": "* Brain Headlines *                 -*-muse-*-\n\n*Great headlines write articles*\n\n**Articles to Consider**\n\n *\n\nSee also [[Home]], [[Headlines]], [[Outlines]], [[Index]], [[Articles]]\n\n\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Brain Headlines"}}, {"pk": 432, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/MyBook/Public/Brain/Title", "time": "2014-06-15T20:37:20.542", "text": "* How to Create a Brain *      -*-muse-*-\n Build your own exterior brain. \n \n By Mark Seaman\n http://exteriorbrain.com\n \n", "user": 3, "title": "How to Create a Brain"}}, {"pk": 433, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/MyBook/Public/NodeHammer/Index", "time": "2014-06-15T20:37:20.728", "text": "* Node Hammer *                                       -*-muse-*-\nTurn-key web site infrastructure\n\nThis open-source project delivers a high-quality commercial grade web site.\nSet up your next site in minutes but customize it until it works exactly like you want.\n\n[[Advantages]]\nGettingStarted\n[[Technology]]\nBasicTricks\nDevelopersWanted\n", "user": 3, "title": "Node Hammer"}}, {"pk": 434, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/MyBook/Public/NodeHammer/Advantages", "time": "2014-06-15T20:37:20.900", "text": "* Advantages *                                       -*-muse-*-\nFully turn-key ...

Unlike books, which have long distribution lead times,\nweb sites are almost never complete. They are always within a state of\ndevelopment.\n\nThe goal with a web site is to make it useful as quickly as\npossible. Once it is functional it should remain in that state. People\nget very frustrated with site that are not always working\nproperly. The goal of this web site is to always be useful and always\nbe growing in an incremental way.\n\nEvery topic can always be broken down into smaller topics. Experience\nhas shown me that if I truly want to understand a subject then it\nshould be described as four roughly equal subtopics. Testing this\nbreakdown requires exploring one more level below each of the legs.\n\nThe 4x4 pattern says that each topic can be broken into four, and that\neach of them can be broken into four. The means that to describe a\nsubject requires decomposing into a structure of 21 related topics.\n\nHaving done the hard work it is very simple to write a paragraph\nexplaining each idea in the outline. The 4x4 pattern is the main\nwriting technique used in building Shrinking-world.org. I encourage\nyou to try out this process on your own favorite writing project.\n\nAs a software engineer I love tools. The difficulty comes when I spend\ntoo much of my project time trying out new software methods and\ntools. Shrinking World Guide is a writing venue where content is\nking. When writing here I will resist the temptation to switch tools.\n\nThat is part of the reason that I chose to use media wiki as the\nwriting platform.

How can you best communicate the key ideas that you have?\nWhat is the best form to engage your readers? This all starts by\nhaving a clear understanding of your audience. What are their hopes\nand dreams? What do they fear most? How can your message connect with\nthose hopes and fears?\n\nWithout this clear understanding of your audience and your purpose in\nwriting you will flounder. It will be difficult to maintain\nmotivation. Your clarity will suffer because you will write for a\ndifferent audience every time you sit down.\n\nShare wisdom from your experience.

The web site is filled with concrete suggestions for helping\nyou to fully utilize technology to simplify your life. There are also\nmany ideas for leaders who wish to expand their leadership capacity.\n\nAs a software engineer, I naturally tend to solve many real-world\nsolutions by using software. For example, any task that requires a\nrepetition of steps can be automated. The steps can be performed\nwithout having to remember the details of how they are down. All that\nyou need to do is express when you want the automatic task\nperformed. This will trigger the desired task automatically.\n\nTo illustrate this, consider a backup task. To automate this task you\nneed to tell the computer what files to backup and where they should\nbe stored. Once this is done then you just tell the backup to\nstart. The details are saved inside the backup script, not\nremembered. Furthermore, you can tell your computer that you wish to\nperform this task every weekday at 9:00 P.M. From then on you will\nhave automatic backup without any further attention on your part.\n\nShrinking World Guides are made for busy people.

The content is written\nfor goal oriented people who are always looking for ways to achieve a\nhigher level of effectiveness.\n\nSome people just love exploring new technologies.

These are typically written at\nthe same time that the product code is turned on.  The act of writing unit tests, encourages good\nprogramming, by highlighting the assumptions and dependencies that a particular function has.\n\nA typical function of four lines should have two test cases that exercise a couple of paths through\nthe function.  Each function should only do a single thing, so you can test a function with two test\ncases.\n\nEach test case should be a single line of code.  It should provide a specific data example that you\nknow the correct answer for.  For example consider the following function and test:\n\n def full_name(first,last): return first+' '+last\n\n assert(full_name('Geek','Squad')=='Geek Squad')\n\nThis test will provide a single example that guarantees one specific example of the correct\nbehavior.  Many people object to this simplistic test strategy, and advocate a more comprehensive\nand robust strategy.\n\nThe unintentional consequence of this philosophy is that most people don't use unit tests at all.\nThe testing becomes too complex because the strategy requires too much effort for the value that it\nreturns.\n\nFollow these simple rules to keep your testing effective:\n\n 1. Write a test for every function.\n 2. Each test should take either one or two lines of code.\n 3. Run related tests each hour and all test once a day.\n 4. Keep it simple, but do it every time.\n 5.

A regression test\ncan be performed on the entire code base just by running all of these tests.  After you write 200\nlines of product code you will have around 200 lines of test code that guarantee that the product is\nrunning properly.\n\nA proper development loop starts with designing the test.  How will you verify that the feature\nworks?  Simply asking this question, will give you higher quality code.  Building and running a test\nwill ensure that this code never suffers bit rot.\n\nThinking of the test first does two things for you.  It guarantees that your code works properly\nnow. It also guarantees that you will know when you accidentally break this function in the\nfuture. If you build this type of testing as you go then you can ensure that your whole system is\ntestable.\n\nSomething will happen that will break the code at some later time.  The primary question is how this\nerror will be detected.  Bit rot is the result of having a growing number of undetected errors in\nyour system.\n\nYou can prevent bit rot by having the unit tests act as guardians over the integrity of each\nfunction that you write.  By running tests daily and fixing every resulting problem you maintain a\nhigh level of quality throughout the lifecycle.  This allows you to survive through many context,\nstructural, and behavioral changes.\n", "user": 3, "title": "Development loop"}}, {"pk": 451, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/MyBook/Public/BitRot/Cure", "time": "2014-06-15T20:37:24.037", "text": "* The Cure for Bit Rot *                 -*-muse-*-\n\nFortunately, there are very effective methods for fighting bit rot.

Your full battery\nof tests should run at least once a day.\n\n**Refactor ruthlessly**\n\nOnce you have tests in place you can confidently modify your code.  Your tests will tell you when\nanything breaks in your code.  This lets you make very dramatic changes to the structure of your\ncode without introducing any new defects.  The design and functionality of your code can be changed\nto match the changes in the environment.\n\n**Fix all known problems**\n\nThe longer problems are in a system the greater the damage will be.

Set goals and\ntrack metrics for how long it takes to remove problems.\n\n**Make changes incrementally**\n\nStart with a baseline of functionality.  Create tests to ensure that the system always remains\nrunning.  If the system ever gets worse then revert the changes and try again.

It is absolutely critical that you remain in control of your system at all\ntimes.

But it lives in a constantly changing world.\nAs software ages it must constantly be changed to match the new world.  If this does not occur then\nthe software stop working properly.\n\nMany of the problems are subtle at first. But over time, become catastopic. These problems result\nfrom changes to the outside system, platform that this system runs on, or the functionality of the\nsystem itself.  All three of these sources gather to form the problem of bit rot.\n\nIf the software changes cannot keep up with the changing environment then problems grow and multiply\nwithin the software.  Bit rot grows dramatically with time.\n\nThe other problem with aging software is that the original team members slowly fade away and the\nknowledge required to keep the system updated is lost.  As this happens the system becomes more\nbrittle and fragile.  Eventually the system becomes so unstable that it no longer performs the\nfunction that it was created for.\n", "user": 3, "title": "What Is Bit Rot ?"}}, {"pk": 457, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/MyBook/Public/BitRot/VersionControl", "time": "2014-06-15T20:37:25.093", "text": "* Strategic version control *                 -*-muse-*-\n\n * version control is not often understood\n * a modern tool must provide minimum requirements\n * navigating through versions must be easy\n * bit rot can be prevented by understanding how the code behaves over time\n\nVersion control is one of the most underutilized tools in the toolbox. Countless hours are spend on\nmost projects due to problems of configuration management.  Every modern project uses some form of\nversion control. But most development teams do not come close to realizing the full power of these\ntools.\n\nA modern version control must prevent each engineer from getting a combination of files that do not\nwork properly together.  It must be very easy to support multiple parallel development branches and\nmerge the results together.  It also must be easy to setup a new archive, add engineers, and\ntroubleshoot problems with the version history.\n\nEvery engineer should be able to work on many branches of code simultaneously without confusing\nthem.  It should be possible to flip back and forth between two branches of code within a few\nseconds.  This makes it effective to track down where particular changes were introduced.\n\nI have used around 15-20 version control systems over the years, and Git is clearly the best one\navailable.  I recommend migration from your current tools into Git to protect your most valuable\nasset (your engineers' time).\n\nChoose a best-in-class version control system like Git and make sure that every engineer is well\ntrained on how to use it.  Dealing with version control and configuration management issues can\neasily eat up 25% of the time for your development team.\n\nVersion control is an important tool in the fight against bit rot.  It allows you to quickly\ninvestigates which versions of the code exhibit a particular defect or behavior.  By systematically\nbisecting a version tree you can isolate the lines of code responsible for a specific problem.\n\nWithout strategic version control, many problems go unresolved.  The cost of investigating an issue\nis deemed to be much larger than the cost of living with the problem.  This makes for sloppy\nengineering. It creates an incentive to pave over problems rather than fix them.\n\nOver time, software gets steadily worse.  Layers of problems are accumulated as patches are\napplied.  Bugs are created withing the system, that eventually compound.

These are typically written at\nthe same time that the product code is turned on.  A typical function of four lines should have two\ntest cases that excercise a couple of paths through the function.  Each test case should be a single\nline of code.  Most people don't use unit tests because they make them too complex.  Keep it simple,\nbut do it every time.\n\nDevelopment loop\n\nHow you construct your development loop, determines how maintainable your code will be three years\nfrom now.

Many authors get into trouble because\nthey are unsure about how to move forward.  If you already have a process that works for\nyou then continue using it.\n\nIf you are uncertain about where to start then this guide may help you.  We define the\nprocess of writing in phases.  Each phase has a set of activities and a desired outcome.\nYou may have some activities that overlap with other phases, but the main attention should\nbe focused on the current phase.\n\nThe four phases are:\n * Outline\n * Draft\n * Edit\n * Share\n\nEach phase culminates with accomplishing a goal.  When you feel that the result has been\nachieved it is time to move into the next phase.  Let's walk through each of the phases\nand look at what is required.\n\n\n**Outline**\n\nThe outline determines the scope of the work.  What one big idea do you want to write\nabout.  A great headline is a way to capture the essence of what you want to say.  Can you\nproduce a single phrase that encapsulates the idea.  Study how the great writers that you\nrespect do it.  Mimic their mojo.\n\nIdentify four major topics that you feel need to be discussed.  I found four to be the\nright number for me.  You will have to experiment with this to find the right number of\nsubtopics to build.   This will depend on a number of factors that may vary by project.\n\nNext you can further decompose the topics into four subtopics each.  This will produce an\noutline that has 21 topics (1+4+16).  By tackling your project in this way you can create\na series of articles that make sense individually or together.\n\nAfter you have developed this material you may find many different purposes for it.  The\nkey to building flexible material is found in the structure of the outline.  You may need\nto use the same material in many different places, contexts, or media types.  A strong\noutline give you the greatest degree of flexibility.\n\nReview your outline.  Is it balanced?  Have you chosen the best topics?  Do you cover the\narea you need to?  Imagine your content as a video.  Does it excite you or put you to sleep?\n\n\n**Draft**\n\nWith a strong outline you are ready to start writing. Create a daily habit of writing.\nFigure out how much you want to do each day put be regular about keeping this new\npractice.  Protect your writing time.\n\nWrite 500 words about each topic without any editing.  With the outline in place it is\neasy to convert the bullet points into sentences.  Add drama and the tone that you wish to\nset.\n\nEditing uses a different part your brain than creating. This phase of writing is a\ncreative process, so postpone all editing activities until later.  Applying judgement to\nyour ideas will shut down the creative process and leave your content very dull.\n\nIt is better to say outrageous things in your first draft and then apply a round of\njudgemental attitudes in order to harness them later.  For now, let your freak flag fly.\n\nIf you write regularly your projects will get done quickly.  At 1000 words a day you can\nwrite a short book in 10 days. 2000 words a day lets you create two independent drafts in 10\ndays.\n\nSelect a regular writing schedule that you can enjoy for the rest of your life.  Even a\nquite modest investment of 15 minutes a day can add up over a year.  Regularity is the\nkey.  Do not choose an initial goal that you can not reasonably sustain.\n\n\n**Editing**\n\nAfter you have complete a draft of your content you are ready to start editing.  Now is\nthe time to apply judgement to your work.\n\nSome writers prefer to set aside their first draft and start from scratch on a new draft.\nThen after the second draft is complete both drafts are reviewed.  These may have\nsignificantly different tone or ideas within them.  I recommend that you experiement to\nsee if this process works for you.\n\nDo three drafts (or three review passes on your text). The first review is to think\nthrough the structure and substance of your content.  Do your examples work?  Are the\nideas solid.  \n\nThe next pass is to find gramar and tone.  Evaluate the length of sentences and word\nchoice.  Make things shorter.  Add punch!\n\nThe last round of editing is for reviewing the overall flow and fixing any spelling\nerrors.  During this review you may have a friend proof your work. You might also hire an\neditor, if the work is important to you.  A competent editor is not very expensive and\nwill catch issues that you will likely miss.\n\n\n**Share**\n\nThere are really two aspects to the sharing phase of your project.  Publishing lets you\nmake your material available for others to find. Connecting is the more proactive way for\nyou content to find others.\n\nThese days, it is best to consider publishing your content in several venues.  The\ninternet makes it easy for one set of material to be consumed in many different ways.\nConsider creating a web site, building a Kindle book, and making a blog.\n\nThe easiest way to publish an ebook is to create and post your Kindle book.  If you have\nused a tool like My Book Online, then it should be easy to get an ebook download of your\nmaterial.  Then you simply go to the Kindle bookstore at Amazon.com and post it.\n\nStart with your static material and make sure that this works well in all cases.  Then you\ncan add rich media (images, video, links) to those venues where it makes sense.  Be\ncareful to create your material so that it can be used in many ways.\n\nNow it is time to invite your friends to the party.  Make new friends and link them back\ninto your web site, ebook, and blog.  The new media options give you an infinite variety\nfor how you can use your content.\n\nYou probably want more than just a web site and an ebook.  Most writers really want to\nconnect with their audience.  They want to build an interactive community in which they\ntoo can participate.\n\nThe fastest way to build a community, is to set up a subscriber list.  This will attract\npeople with similar interests, and allow you to communicate with them.  Once you have this\nconversation going, you can request feedback.  This makes the conversation go both ways.\n\nYou will start by setting up a subscriber list and build a story that will truly engage\nyour readers.  It could contain excerts from your book or be entirely different content\naltogether.\n\nYou can include links in the emails to your list that will bring users back to your web\nsite.  You can host interactive events on your web site and use your email list to invite\nparticipation. \n", "user": 3, "title": "Chapter 2 - Essential steps to publishing"}}, {"pk": 465, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/MyBook/Public/MyBookOnline/Outline4", "time": "2014-06-15T20:37:26.465", "text": "* Chapter 4 - Have more impact *                                       -*-muse-*-\n\nKindle\n\n    The Kindle store is an ideal choice\n    Easy to publish\n    Low cost\n    High reward\n\nSubscriber list\n\n    Creating your list\n    Getting your readers attention\n    Hearing your readers feedback\n    Creating an online forum\n\nBlogging\n\n    Starting an ongoing conversation\n    Extend your expertise\n    Bring in other people\n    Build a team of experts\n\nYour next project\n\n    Leverage your content\n    Leverage your subscribers\n    Leverage your credibility\n    Achieve your dreams\n", "user": 3, "title": "Chapter 4 - Have more impact"}}, {"pk": 466, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/MyBook/Public/MyBookOnline/Overview", "time": "2014-06-15T20:37:26.625", "text": "* Overview *                                       -*-muse-*-\n\nMost people have a story to tell.  But few will actually ever get the\nchance. Unfortunately, the process of getting your writing published can be daunting.\nMany potential authors never actual publish their work at all.\n\nWhat if publishing were really easy?  Do you have a story you would like to share?  Do you\nhave expertise that you belive would help others?\n\nNow you can!  Publishing is not difficult. There are just a few simple steps to follow.\nAnyone can write a book and get it published.\n\nTraditional publishing no longer works for many writers.  It is built to service the needs\nof a few authors that crank out best sellers.  This existing system prevents many potential\nauthors from trying out a new found love of writing.  The barrier to enter the market is\nsimply too high.\n\nIt is time for a change.  Anyone should be able to publish content.  Even if you have a\nsmall audience, you should be able to provide them with high quality content.\n\nThe process of publishing should not require that you mortgage your house or quit your\njob.  Once you have access to easy publishing, you can begin to build a\nfollowing.  You can speak directly to like-minded people who share your interests.\n\nIf you already have written content then you are most of the way there already.  Think\nabout how to share it with others.  You may just be hours away from inspiring, motivating,\nor entertaining your readers.\n\nEmbark on a journey from expert to author.  Everyone has a unique story or viewpoint to\nshare.  Why not think about how to share your story.  What do you know that can benefit\nothers?  Think about recording that, and passing it on.\n\nThe internet changes everything.  Now everyone has a voice.  And your voice can be heard\nglobally.  You can be heard by people with very selective interests.  You reach can be\nworld wide.\n\nThe world is a much smaller place than it used to be.  Let's start clearing the obstacles to\ncreating a live conversation with your followers.  Imagine the result of being able to\ncommunicate with many people that you have never even met.\n\nYour publishing project will have four essential phases.  Each of the phases are fairly\nsimple and can be planned in advance.  You should start out small.  Select a modest\nwriting goal for your first project and complete it entirely before going to the next\nproject.\n\nThis process of writing is built for non-fiction authors but can easily be adapted for works of\nfiction.  In this book we mostly apply these ideas to non-fiction.\n\nThe four phases of your project are:\n * Planning\n * Writing\n * Editing\n * Sharing\n\nDuring the planning phase you will clarify your goals for writing.  You will also be\nturning your key ideas into an outline.  I will walk you through a very effective process\nfor making you ideas pop!\n\nYou will start by creating an outline, which provides the skeleton for your work.  The\noutline defines the size and scope of the content that you wish to cover.  During the\nwriting phase you will be building upon the outline.\n\nWhen the outline is complete you will write a series of articles for each part of the\noutline.  By using this technique you can write content that makes sense either\nindependently or as an entire collection.\n\nWriting will continue by producing a series of drafts of your articles.  You will probably\nwant to build three drafts.   Each draft will have different goals.  By reading your\nearlier writing you will be able to catch many of your common mistakes.\n\nNow, your draft is ready for the editing phase.  It is a good idea to get someone else to\nread and edit your work.  You will not be able to catch many your own mistakes, because\nyou are blinded to them.  We will explore several alternative options for editing and\nproof reading later on.\n\nWhen your material is ready, post it online.  We will explore several useful tools for releasing\nyour content to the world.  In particular, we recommend My Book Online, Kindle Books, and\nWord Press for publishing your work.\n\nFinally, you should consider building an online forum for your readers.  This elevates\nyour work from a one-time release to an ongoing conversation with your readers.  We will\nwalk you through the process of setting all this up.

Each person is unique, and that very uniqueness makes your\nstory interesting.  No one else has had your specific life experiences.  Even twins raised\nin the same family can have significant differences.\n\nThroughout your life you become interested in many topics.  These interests allow you to\ndevelop a unique body knowledge and expertise.  Others can benefit from your knowledge.\nThe internet now makes it easy to find others interested in what you know.\n\nIn the past, it require large resources to finance the marketing effort to find an\naudience.  Times have certainly changed.  Now Google lets people interested in what you\nhave to say find you.  Anyone can have a voice.\n\nBeyond what you know, people can benefit form your unique viewpoint.  Your life\nexperiences have shaped how you see the world.  Things that have happened to you and how\nyou have reacted to them define what you believe to be true.\n\nGreat writers can have a huge influence on others.  Describe your world-view in a way to\ninspire and motivate.  Help someone solve a problem.  Shred light on a dark secret that\nneeds to be told.  Seek to make the world a better place by your words and ideas.\n\nSeek to express your passion.  Tells people why you love certain things and are utterly\nfrustrated with others.  Make your case.  Win people over.  Start a revolution.  Stir up\nsome good!\n\nBecause of the difficulties of publishing, many potential writers have remained silent.\nIn the past, it has been too difficult to get to your readers. Journalism was confined to\nmagazines and newspapers that mostly hired full-time staff.\n\nPublishing houses set up extremely difficult hurdles for publishing books.  Many authors\nare simply not willing to make the investment required to overcome these barriers.\n\nThe internet makes distribution free and easy.  Now it is possible for anyone to publish\ncontent and find the potential readers.  This has created an explosion of low quality\ncontent.  But it has also allowed a lot of high-quality and thought-provoking\ncontent.\n\nOne of the fascinating things about the internet, is how quickly the high quality is\nrecognized by the crowd.   The term \"going viral\" refers to the overwhelming popularity\nthat is given to reward true innovation.\n\nIf you have something interesting to say you will be heard.  You don't need a huge\nmarketing budget or an agent.  Focus on your message and not how you will get the word\nout.\n\nFor effective writing you will need to set up a few basic processes.  Each part of the\noverall writing process lets you focus on a single aspect. The goal is clear the common\nobstacles by creating standard work practices for writing, editing, posting, Kindle book\nformatting, and building community.\n\nThe value of standardized process, is that it lets you concentrate on the subject material\nrather than focusing on the mechanics of writing or publishing.  A typical writing project\nof 10,000 words (40 pages), may take you between 50-80 hours depending on your writing\nspeed.\n\nMeasure you actual effort for a certain size project.   This is the best indicator of your\nfuture effort on a similar project.  I measure the words written by hour during the four major\nactivities (outline, draft, edit, share).  This makes it very easy to predict the next\nproject.\n\nImagine the result.  You can create a steady stream of written content with a predictable\namount of effort.  You can publish this material effortlessly.  You can also build a way\nfor your readers to give you feedback and new ideas.\n", "user": 3, "title": "Chapter 1 - From expert to author in 50 hours"}}, {"pk": 469, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/MyBook/Public/MyBookOnline/Outline1", "time": "2014-06-15T20:37:27.159", "text": "* Chapter 1 -

Some people are naturally good\nat think through problems and coming up with great solutions.  Here are a few patterns that can help\nyou in thinking better.\n\n**List limit of 9 items**\n\nPsychological studies have shown that people can only retain up to nine items in short-term memory.\nThis means that any list where you expect a selection ony works up to nine items.  Longer lists\nshould be broken into multiple selection lists.  A reasonable list should have five or more items to\nbe useful.  Nesting can be used to handle more complicated scenarios.\n\n**Minimize mindshare**\n\nSome things we can control and other things we cannot.  Try to make your circle of influence match\nyour circle of concern.  Decrease the amount of mental energy that you invest in areas where you\nhave little influence.  Save your energy for the things that you can change.\n\n**Eliminate multitasking**\n\nYour worst enemy is multiple tasks interrupting each other. Focus on one activity as much as\npossible until it is completed.  Then go on to the next with equal focus.  It is very easy for us to\nspend as much as 50% of our overall time just switching between multiple tasks.  This has become\nespecially bad in our modern world.  Most people underestimate the cost of multitasking.\n\n**Scheduled thinking**\n\nConsider having a block of time scheduled to think through problems.  Imagine knowing that you could\njust file that issue away for 3:00 Thursday.  I recommend that you perform this think time in a\nlocation where you cannot be interrupted.  Start with one hour per week.  You are likely to find\nthat you need more time, and that it is easily justified by the return that you get.\n\n**Think before you leap**\n\nWhen confronted with a big decision consider taking both paths.  Imagine trying to live with each of\nthe alternatives.  Which one seems to carry the least risk?  Which is better in the short term or in\nthe long term?  What problem might surface?  What does your intuition tell you?\n\n**Brainstorm/organize**\n\nA great way to work out problems is to brainstorm.  This typically involves making a list of various\nideas or impression.  During a brainstorm try to postpone judgment.  Once you have captured a bunch\nof ideas you can work on grouping things together.  This is the time to apply some judgment and\npruning.\n\n**Four by four analysis**\n\nIn order to think through, a topic try this technique. Break your main topic into four roughly equal\ntopics.  Then decompose each of them into four more topics.  I found that this technique is\nremarkably useful to help me see the interesting aspects of almost any subject. It gives you twenty\none statements that have both breadth and depth that can be explored later.\n\n**Work on only one thing**\n\nSelect a single task that will be the most satisfying to have done.  Postpone distractions until\nthis task is complete. By selecting this task you are saying that this is the most important thing\nthat you could do right now.  If you feel that a legitimate interruption is likely then limit the\nscope of your task to complete it sooner. Then you can focus on another task when needed.\n\n**Use tools that preserve context**\n\nDon't have multiple windows up on your computer (each vying for your attention). When you run an\napplication, make the window take the full screen. Finish one thought before going on the next.\nTurn off email notification, and check it between tasks.  If you don't control your tools they will\ncontrol you.  Know what you must do in your job to succeed and create the environment that lets you\nfocus.  If your job calls for 10 second response time on IM, then play along.  If it is a constant\ndistraction, turn it off.\n\n**Try new things**\n\nBreak your routine occassionally.  Keep a list of random things to do for fun.  At least once a\nweek, pick a fun thing and do it.  Life is too serious for most of us. Look up an old friend.  Do a\nrandom act of kindness.  Play a practical joke.  Tell someone that you love them.\n\n**Random item from the past**\n\nImagine having a list of things to think about someday.  Now image doing a random selection from\nthat list.  This would give you a miscellaneous topic to ponder for a few minutes.  I use this\ntechnique for a number of different lists.  I frequently get emails of ticklers to remind me of\nthings that I originally thought about earlier.  The key idea here is to have a list of topics and a\nrandom selection.  You could do the same thing by shuffling 3 x 5 cards with ideas.\n\n**Say in fewer words**\n\nI like to make complex subjects simple.  One way to do this is to describe something and then try to\ncapture the same ideas with half of the words.  Is it possible to get the same idea in 5 words?

Everyone can benefit from learning new skills.  We\nare all in a perpetual state of personal growth throughout our lives.  \n\nDon't ever stop learning.  Here are some patterns that will help you to continue developing as a person.\n\n**Yearly conference** \n\nSelect a conference within your profession.  Use this as an opportunity to\ntake the pulse of your industry.  Interact with others as much as possible.  Build a list of new\nopportunities for further exploration.\n\n**Skim a book** \n\nGo to the library or book store.  Select a book that catches your eye.  Spend on\nhour to get the most that you can from the book.  Write a single paragraph about what you learned\nfrom this book.  Concentrate on the one big idea of the book.  Think about the structure of\nsubjects in the chapters.  Decide if you would like to read the book in detail sometime later.\n\n**Study a book** \n\nFind the best book on the subject that you want to learn.  Create a set of notes\nthat highlights what you find useful in the book. Outline the structure of the table of contents.\nWrite one paragraph for each chapter in the book. Select four parts that you want to remember five\nyears from now. Describe these in detail. Learn about sources for finding out more in each of these\nareas. \n\n**Capture ideas** \n\nPractice capturing ideas quickly.  The typical idea will evaporate in five\nseconds.  Can you capture it first? Try always carrying a pen and pad. Have an idea list on your\ncomputer.  Set aside time to process your idea list.  Use old ideas to spark new ones.\n\n**Learn and share best practices** \n\nDecide that you want to develop best practices.  Make a list\nof practices that you use, and a list of ones that you are still working on.  Set aside time to\nrefine these 'how to' ideas.  Share them with others and ask for input.  Reject practices that no\nlonger work for you.\n\n**Learning budget** \n\nBuy lots of books or become a regular at the library.  They are cheap, but your\ntime is not. Move to ebooks so that you can always have them with you.  Read only if you get\nsomething out of it.  Don't read a lame book; life is too short. Nibble on something tasty.  When\nyou are done with a book give it away.\n\n**Learning ROI** \n\nInvest is learning things that will give you the most value.  Constantly be\nthinking about the return on investment of what you learn. What skills do you most wish that you\nhad?  Pursue these first.  Go broad to lower your risk.  Go deep to get extreme value.\n\n**Dreyfus scale** \n\nAll learning goes through five unique stages: Novice, Beginner, Competent,\nProficient, Expert.  Learn what these levels mean and how to tell what level you are at for each\nskill that you use.  Make an inventory of skills you have and ones you need.  Focus your learning\nto close the skill gap.\n\n**Learning curve** \n\nAny trick that you know can be performed in an hour.  You can learn any trick in\na day.  A project is usually a series of tricks.  Count how many tricks are needed and how many you\nalready know.  Estimate 8 hours for every new trick, and an hour for known ones.  A trick that you\nhave done once or twice is worth 4 hours.  Sum the total time.  Double the total to account for\nsurprises. The result is very close to what you will actually spend.\n\n**Remember what you've learned** \n\nWrite down everything that you learn in an electronic notebook.\nUse a wiki to organize your ideas.  Allow the structure to evolve over time.  Constantly fiddle\nwith the content making a series of small changes.  Have some areas that are highly organised and\nothers that are highly chaotic.  Let the content express its own organization.  Review and remove\nold topics.  Use new topics to spur others.  Make your own wikipedia.\n\n**Learn every week** \n\nSet aside several hours each week just for learning.  This will quickly become\nyour favorite time.  Fill the regular time with regular activities.  Balance usefulness with\nenjoyment. Have a list of subjects that you would like to research or skills to develop.  Meet with\nfriends to discover what they are learning.\n \n**Investment model for learning** \n\nMaximize the benefit from the effort you put in.  Some books are\nworth a skim, others warrant full-body emersion.  Some events or classes are worth a great deal of\ntime while others are not worthwhile at all.  Become discerning enough to distinguish between\nthem.  Try to measure value in hours.\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Learning"}}, {"pk": 482, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/MyBook/Public/Patterns/Design", "time": "2014-06-15T20:37:29.435", "text": "* Design *                 -*-muse-*-\n\n * Mental model first\n * Simplify before coding\n * Fundamental data types\n * Fundamental operations\n * Use cases\n * Core/added functions\n * Short files (200 lines)\n * Short functions (5 lines)\n * Small modules (10 files)\n * Constant refactoring\n * Do one thing (module, class, function)\n * Write three-times (technology, features, structure)\n * Layers of abstration\n * Rules apply everywhere\n * Develop your own design rules\n * Learn rules from others\n * Follow the leader\n", "user": 3, "title": "Design"}}, {"pk": 483, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/MyBook/Public/Patterns/Home", "time": "2014-06-15T20:37:29.593", "text": "* Best Practices for Better Living *                 -*-muse-*-\n\nI have always been interested in best practices.

This lifecycle is described as eight stages.\nWhen developing a project around an idea we can group the project into\nfour development stages.  Each stage can be built around a pair of\nlifecyle phases.\n\n**Inception**\n\nThis project phase is where the idea first comes together.  An idea is\na unique and interesting connection between other ideas. It does not\nexist in isolation.  \n\nDuring inception the idea is first captured and the primary\nconnections are created.  It is evaluated to see if it is worth\npursuing any further.\n\nA simple plan emerges for how the benefits of this new idea can be\napplied to problems that must be solved.  The core concept must be\ntested to see if it is viable in a large range of contexts or if the\nbig idea can only be applied in a very narrow situation.  This plan\nshould also contain an estimate of the return on investment.\n\n**Exploration**\n\nNew ideas must become real.  A prototype of the idea, or a rough draft\nof the writing must be created that can be experimented on.  This may\nor may not evolve into the final product.  The important part of this\nstage is to generate a thorough undertanding of the key aspects and\nlimitations of the idea.\n\nThe goal of this stage is learning not production.  In order to\npromote a new idea you must know what other people have tried and why\nit didn't work.  You must also know when your new idea will work and\nwhen it will not produce the desired result.  Every idea will work\nwithin a context.\n\n**Development**\n\nNow it is time to cook your idea down to its core.  What simple\nconcept are you adding to what has already been done?  This phase is\nabout teaching someone else in the simplest possible terms.\n\nI've written a lot of patent applications.  The goal of a patent\napplication is to allow lawyers to defend the legal rights of an\ninvention. They are written to be obscure and difficult to understand.\n\nOur goal is to communicate an idea to the largest possible audience.\nMinimize buzzwords and assumptions about someones current\nunderstanding.  Use simple words and simple concepts to explain your\nbreakthrough.\n\n**Replication**\n\nA great idea only has power when someone else uses it.  Ideas should\nnot be horded.  The goal is to get the idea to replicate.  A great\nidea produces value for everyone.  We all win by freely sharing.\nIdeas are about connections and so they naturally die if kept by\nthemselves.\n\nDuring the replication phase your only goal is to make people aware of\nyour idea and willing to use it.  Adoption is the key.  If it is a\nbusiness idea then you will be able to reap a monetary benefit from\nbeing there first.\n\nIn an ecconmonic race, connection always wins over protection.\nDefending so anything that has no true innovation is riddiculous, but\nit happens all the time.\n", "user": 3, "title": "Project Phases"}}, {"pk": 490, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/MyBook/Public/Ideas/Collaboration", "time": "2014-06-15T20:37:30.821", "text": "* The Power of Collaboration *                 -*-muse-*-\n\nIdeas only have value when shared, not when they are kept private.  This is often misunderstood by\npeople that work with ideas for a living.  Our instinct is to hide ideas thinking that they are\nassets that can be protected.  \n\nIdeas are a network of connections that have no real impact in isolation.  Protection is the wrong\ngoal because more connections are made when sharing with others. Ideas in isolation starve to death.\nBut sharing causes them to grow stronger as more connections are made.\n\nCollaboration is a great way to build trust. Relationships are built on trust and sharing ideas\ndemonstrates your desire to trust.  In return others instinctively trust you more.  If you allow\nothers to influence you, this also increases trust. Collaboration is a consistent habit of giving\nand receiving.  Both of these actions grow trust.\n\nBuild stronger ideas by exposing them to multiple people. Ideas are refined as others are exposed to\nyour thinking.  Unchallenged assumptions are dangerous and inevitable, if you never open up to\nothers.\n\nSelf-deception is easy to prevent.  It all starts with an openness to share what you know. The level\nof synergy that results is often surprising.   We always generate more when we work together.\n\nA half-baked idea can easily turn into a winner by discussing it with a friend.  Get value by\ncollaborating with others.  You don't have to generate everything yourself.  It takes a village to\nfully develop a plan, concept, or project.\n\nOthers have resources you need.  By trusting them with what you know you create a partnership that\nwill take you much further than you could go alone.  Make it your goal to never attempt anything\nalone.  Why not bring along a companion and collaborator?  There is always enough to share at the\nend when you win together.\n\nInfluence is the highest goal for ideas. Your desire should be to make the world a better place by\nusing what you know.  Convert weak and fruitless ideas, into powerful ideas that can change some\ncorner of the world.  This will only be realized by the power of collaboration.\n\n\n\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "The Power of Collaboration"}}, {"pk": 491, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/MyBook/Public/Ideas/IdeasAreCurrency", "time": "2014-06-15T20:37:31.009", "text": "* Ideas Are Currency *                 -*-muse-*-\n\nIdeas are the fuel that runs our modern society.  They are the\ncurrency of trade and the prize at the end.  Lawyers refer to them as\nIntellectual Property.  They propell businesses to succuess and hold\nsome governments in power while letting others fall.\n\nThere is no question about it.  Ideas are important.  Why then, don't\nwe spend more time thinking about how to get more ideas, or cultivate\nthe ones that we have?\n\nI think fear is the main obstacle.  We believe that ideas are to be\nprottected and guarded.  After all, if we share our idea then someone\nelse might profit from it.  So we hide it away, hoping that someday we\nwill be able to reap untold millions off it.\n\nThis scarcity mindset fails to recognize two truths. First, your idea\nis born in the needs that you perceive.  It is very likely that\nsomeone else in your exact position will come up with precisely the\nsame idea as you.  You idea is almost certainly not unique.\n\nSecond, ideas must be tempered by others.  You need the interaction of\nother minds thinking about the same issues. What you think is a fully\nformed idea may be quickly revealed to be half-baked when you try to\nput it into use. The remaining baking is best done by the\ncontributions of others.\n\nGreat ideas are best developed in a team environment, or sometimes\na competitive one. We make the biggest gain when the interactions of\nseveral people help to evaluate, extend, and refine the ideas.\n\nI recently read about Google and the amazing environment that was\ncreated at Stanford University.  This setting is undoubtedly the most\nnurturing environment ever created for the advancement of\ntechnology ever.  Many entire industries have their roots in this amazing\nfoundry of ideas.\n\nThe internet has also given us new opportunities to help people\ndevelop ideas.\n", "user": 3, "title": "Ideas Are Currency"}}, {"pk": 492, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/MyBook/Public/Ideas/YourIdeasDontMatter", "time": "2014-06-15T20:37:31.192", "text": "* Why your ideas don't matter *                 -*-muse-*-\n\nIs it frustrating to you that you get these great ideas but can get\nanyone to take action on them?  Have you ever had a great idea that\nyou found years later as a product?\n\nI used to have great ideas (or so I thought), that never went\nanywhere. An idea is a seed of something great.  It is not the great\nthing itself.  An idea, by itself, is not really a thing of value.  It\nmust be cultivated and developed in order to blossom into something\nworthwhile. \n\nThe idea is the conception point of something great.  Once an idea is\nborn it can grow into a project.  This takes it from the realm of\npossibility to the realm of actuality.  Most ideas are not strong\nenough to support this type of investment, but some are.\n\nI'm an engineer by profession.  We translate ideas into practical\nthings to make life better.  The true value of an idea is in the thing\nthat is produced by the idea.  Does it solve a real-world problem?\n\nMany people wish to sell their ideas.  They falsely assume that they\nare the first person to think of it.  In reality, many people think of\nthe same improvements when seeing a specific problem.  But few people\nmake the investment required to bring the idea to life.\n\nDeveloping an idea requires invention.  Seeing the potential is one\nthing, but realizing the actual potential is another.  True invention\nrequires solving all of the problems that make something inpractical.\n\nBuisness always rewards people who create things.  There is not much\nvalue for those who merely dream about inventing things.  Consider\ndeveloping an inventory of great ideas that you have.\n\nVisit this inventory frequently.  Select the strongest ideas and\nfigure out what the next step should be.  Does the concept itself need\nto improved?  Are you ready to build a prototype?  Is it ready to turn\ninto a business?  Are you ready to publish the idea as a book?\n\nGrow your ideas.  Treasure them.  Cultivate them.  Let them produce\nvalue for you.

By modifying the goal we can avoid the string of failure\naltogether.  We often set out big goals with pass/fail outcomes.\n\nLet me illustrate with an example.  Let's say that we need to buy a\nnew car.  One way to approach it is to assume that we already have all\nof the information that we need, and that the next step is to get a\ncar.  We go to a specific dealer and expect to be driving off the lot\nin a beautiful new car that won't break the budget.\n\nThe failure here is with our expectations, not with our ability.  We\nassume that the task is probably easy and will not require that much\nenergy.  However, many important things in real life are hard and\nrequire an enormous amount of energy.\n\nYou cannot get married, raise kids, buy a house, get a job, or buy a\ncar as an event.  These are huge goals, or rather, outcomes of\naccomplishing many goals.  The problem is that if you believe that any\none of these thing can be done easily then you approach it with the\nwrong mindset.\n\nA happier way is to assume that the eventual outcome that you want is\nbuilt on achieving smaller, more realistic, goals.  In our car\nexample, you should think about investigating on-line/dealer sales,\ndecide on financing, investigate car selection, decide on impact with\nthe insurance, and and vacation plans.\n\nAny goal that starts with \"learn about\" is sure to succeed.  This\neliminates the fear of failure.  You cannot fail to learn something.\nYou might not like what you learn.  But that is a different issue.\n\nOnce you are fully informed about the situation you are much more\nlikely to succeed at the ultimate goal.  Consider your actions to be\nexperiments that will give you enough understanding to take more\nactions.  This will prevent you from walking into a lot of blind\nalleys.\n", "user": 3, "title": "Reduce Fear of Failure"}}, {"pk": 496, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/MyBook/Public/Ideas/ChoosingToAct", "time": "2014-06-15T20:37:31.881", "text": "* Choosing To Act *                 -*-muse-*-\n\nHow do you select the next thing to act on?

The first step in selecting what to act on is choosing which\nproject warrants your attention.\n\nIf you can postpone any project without feeling anything then do it.\nAn urgent project will create a feeling of anguish when you attempt to\npostpone it.

The project that should get your attention\nis the one that demands you to act soon.\n\nThe desire to act can be motivated by a positive feeling (by realizing\nthe great benefit that you could get), or by a negative emotion (this\nwill be painful if you don't address it).

If you take a series of small\nsteps you will learn what really works and what doesn't. \n\nWhen you are facing a problem that is unknowable, then action is the\nquickest way to understanding.  Design each step as an experiment that\nwill help you better grasp the key factors in the unknown situation.\n\nThe next step on any specific project should be to maximize your\nlearning.  If you already understand the project fully then this is\nnot needed because the impact of your actions is absolutely\npredictable.  Most projects have a large number of unknown things that\nmust be approached in this way.\n\nThese questions will help you to define your next step:\n    1. What am I most passionate about?\n    2. What do I already know?\n    3. What resources can I invest?\n    4. Who can help me?\n\nSpend about 10% of your time developing the answers to these\nquestions.  This will give you a great deal of direction in your\nproject.  When you feel like you have a solid understanding of your\nobjective then answer the following questions.\n\n    5. What can I do to learn the most?\n    6. How much am I willing to lose?\n    7. What is the expected outcome?\n\nDo each step to move closer to your goal and to gain understanding.  A\nwell designed step will often pay for itself.  Then follow up on\neverything that is learned in the process.   If the benefit exceeds\nthe cost then you can continue this process forever.\n\nIf you truly learn from each step that you take then the benefit will\nfar exceed the cost of each step.  When you achieve a big win, then\nstudy why that was so successful.  Continue to pursue this new line of\nlogic to duplicate the success.\n\nAdapt constantly.  Do more of what works, and less of what doesn't.\nCreate an agenda of other experiments and prioritize them based on the\nbenefit that they would give you.\n\n\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Next Step"}}, {"pk": 499, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/MyBook/Public/Ideas/GreatIdeas", "time": "2014-06-15T20:37:32.439", "text": "* What makes a great idea? *                 -*-muse-*-\n\nThere are a lot of ideas floating around.   How can you tell the\ndifference between a great idea and an horrible one?  All great ideas have\ncertain common elements.  It is easy to recognize a great idea when\nyou know what to look for.\n\nAn idea never exists by itself. It always connects with other ideas.\nIt builds upon them and extends them in some meaningful way.  This\nmeans that an idea requires the right time and place in order to make\nit successful.  An idea that is \"ahead of it's time\" will not succeed\nbecause there may be certain prerequists missing.\n\nA great idea solves a real problem.  As an inventer I tend to look at\nthe world through the lens of real problems and potential solutions.\nSolving a problem produces value.  Ideas are a better way to address\nsome problem that people are having.\n\nIt takes energy to solve problems, but it also produces a\nbenefit. Attempt to understand the expected return on the investment\nof any solution before implementing it.\n\nSome ideas require a lot of effort to fully implement them.  For these,\nit is best to create some kind of an experiment to verify the expected\nROI.  Try to reduce the cost of any idea that you are about to\nimplement to what you are willing to lose.\n\nTackle a big idea as a series of smaller ideas.  This way you limit\nthe risk of your big idea not working out, while producing real value\nsooner. As you implement the smaller ideas you may find that your over\ngoal changes from what you learn.\n\nMany ideas sound great when discussing them, but fail when you try to\nimplementat them.  This is why it is good to try to implement the idea\nas soon as possible.  Learn what works an doesn't work, before you\ncommit too many resources.\n\nUse what you learn to modify your approach and refine the idea\nitself.  Prevent failure by learning and adapting.\n", "user": 3, "title": "What makes a great idea?"}}, {"pk": 500, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/MyBook/Public/Ideas/ActToLearn", "time": "2014-06-15T20:37:32.697", "text": "* Act To Learn *                 -*-muse-*-\n\nI just read a terrific book.  It is called \"Action Trumps Everything\".\nIt is about creating what you want in an uncertain world.  What do you\ndo when the future is inherently unknowable and unpredictable?  Most\nof the tools that we have are for projecting past experience into the\nfuture.\n\nThe big idea of the book is that if you cannot know the future you can\ntake small steps and learn.  Each action creates learning which in\nturn defines the next action.  Instead of creating a map of the entire\njourney to your destination consider moving one step closer.\n\nJust moving toward your goal will make you aware of things that you\ncould not possibly have forseen.  No amount of thinking about your\ngoal will be better than a real experiment. \n\nIf your action is done to learn then no outcome is a bad outcome.  If\nyou are hoping to start a business but you find out that there are not\nenough customers, then that is a very positive outcome.  The most\nimportant goal of each experiment is to learn.\n\nBe willing to fully follow up on everything that you learn.  \n    1. Adapt to the new realities that you find by changing strategy.\n    2. Learn what next steps have the biggest opportunity.\n    3. Adjust your goals by what you learn.\n\nControl your investment on each step.  Make sure that you understand\nwhat you can afford to lose, and what you are willing to lose.  These\nare often two different things.\n\nAct quickly.  In order to make progress it is important to keep the\nsteps small.  Try to reduce the size of your steps to maximize\neffectiveness.  Identify things that you could do this month or this\nweek.  Even better, pick something that you could do today.\n\nIn situations where you cannot predict the future, it is best to\ncreate it.  Actions will allow you to shape the future that you most\ndesire. Use what you learn along the way to follow the path of highest\nbenefit. \n", "user": 3, "title": "Act To Learn"}}, {"pk": 501, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/MyBook/Public/Ideas/Title", "time": "2014-06-15T20:37:32.882", "text": "* Ideas *      -*-muse-*-\nHow to get, develop, and share them more\n \n By Mark Seaman\n http://ideas.shrinking-world.com\n \n", "user": 3, "title": "Ideas"}}, {"pk": 502, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/WmLineCount", "time": "2014-06-15T20:37:41.013", "text": "* Watermill Line Count *                 -*-muse-*-\n\n** Watermill Code **\n\n~/wme/application-git/source(master)$ cloc-1.09.pl .\n     815 text files.\n     802 unique files.                                          \n     332 files ignored.\n\nhttp://cloc.sourceforge.net v 1.09  T=0.5 s (948.0 files/s, 120430.0 lines/s)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLanguage           files     blank   comment      code    scale   3rd gen. equiv\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nC++                  141      5182      2579     25257 x   1.51 =       38138.07\nC/C++ Header         127      4966      4373      9266 x   1.00 =        9266.00\nXML                    4         0         0      1422 x   1.90 =        2701.80\nBourne Again Shell   113       443       364      1406 x   3.81 =        5356.86\nPython                27       286       240       955 x   4.20 =        4011.00\nPerl                   6       152       268       866 x   4.00 =        3464.00\nBourne Shell          47       264       436       619 x   3.81 =        2358.39\nPHP                    8        98        51       618 x   3.50 =        2163.00\nHTML                   1         1         4        99 x   1.90 =         188.10\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSUM:                 474     11392      8315     40508 x   1.67 =       67647.22\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n~/wme/application-git/source(master)$ lc `sf-names|egrep '\\.cpp'|gv test.cpp`\n    14492 total\n\n~/wme/server-git/support(millsvr)$ lc `sf-names|egrep '\\.h'`\n    8144 total\n\n~/wme/server-git/support(millsvr)$ lc `sf-names|grep '.py'`\n    1531 total\n\n~/wme/application-git/scripts(master)$ lc `ls|gv cloc-1.09.pl|gv sequence.pic`\n    1720 total\n\n~/wme/server-git/support(millsvr)$ lc `sf-names|grep '.test'`\n    3674 total\n\n\n** Server code **\n\ncd $s\nmv media ..\n\n~/wme/server-git/support(millsvr)$ /home/seaman/wme/application-git/scripts/cloc-1.09.pl $s\n\n     384 text files.\n     352 unique files.                                          \n     105 files ignored.\n\nhttp://cloc.sourceforge.net v 1.09  T=0.5 s (496.0 files/s, 22930.0 lines/s)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLanguage           files     blank   comment      code    scale   3rd gen. equiv\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPython               186      1616      1211      6848 x   4.20 =       28761.60\nHTML                  56       132        29      1504 x   1.90 =        2857.60\nBourne Again Shell     6        24        26        75 x   3.81 =         285.75\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSUM:                 248      1772      1266      8427 x   3.79 =       31904.95\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n** Productivity **\n\nEquivalent lines of code: 68K (product), 32K (server)\n\nEstimated software effort: 4 years * 2 programmers * 250 days = 2000 engineer days\n\nIndustry average productivity:  10 lines/day\n\nOur productivity: 50 lines/day\n\n\nSee also [[Watermill]]\n\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Watermill Line Count"}}, {"pk": 503, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/SoftwareTeam", "time": "2014-06-15T20:37:41.244", "text": "* Building a Software Team *                 -*-muse-*-\n\nHow you can build a team that wins every time.\n\n*Goals and plans*\n * Incremental\n * Reduce rework\n * Immediate benefit -

These are typically also moments that\nare captured in the daily highlights.\n\n**Week of Feb 4**\n\nLucy has been visiting us for the last two weeks. Last week she collapsed and was taken by ambulance\nto the hospital where she received a pace maker. After four days in the hospital she returned home\nwhere she continues to mend. This has increased our overall stress level, but God is working\neverything out.\n\nJosiah is doing really good now.  He has been visiting a chairopracter since November which has had\na remarkable impact on him.  Cassandriel is now five months old and so precious.  Josiah and Sam are\nboth great parents.  So loving and patient.\n\nRachel is doing great.  She plans to return from Japan in August.\n\nChristine recently started working at Xerox in the call center.  She is in her fourth week of\ntraining.\n\nI had some ups and downs with the business but feel good moving forward with it.  I recently have\ntaken on learning about Node.js and related technology to use for the pipe scan project.  I'm\nexploring setting up a new business to do vertical applications for end users.\n\n\n**Week of July 26**\n\nJosiah has been essentially disabled since May 4.  The first week of July he was granted a leave of\nabsence from his doctoral program for up to a year.  Last week he had a battery of tests including\nMRI and EEG.  He said that the EEG captured 20-30 events that can be analyzed.  With a baby girl on\nthe way in October, Josiah and Sam are very stressed over the future.\n\nIn April I decided to end my work with Watermill.  Over the four years I have been working with them\nI have been able to build what they needed.  Now they don't need the full-time work from someone\nlike me.  I am planning on working for Watermill one day each week during August.\n\nI have been working on plans for the next phase of my career.  The most promising path forward is to\ndevelop a short course on software engineering that I can use to help get longer term consulting\nwork. I will present a training session to the software arichtects group in three weeks on Fighting\nBit Rot.  I hope that this will lead to other work opportunities.\n\n**Week of Jan 16**\n\nThis week I saw how volatile life can really be.  I was almost in a head-on accident, which would\nhave been my fault.  I ran a red light, while rushing to get through an intersection on snowy roads.\n\nA day later a teen was killed when a driver crossed the line on 257. \n\nA routine furnace inspedtion revealed that our furnace was inproperly constructed.  We replaced it\nwith a new one and an air conditioner.  This cost us $11K that we were not expecting.\n\nI finally got a budget for our family.  It has a nice simple outline: Tax 30%, Giving Housing Living\nall 20%, Vaction 10%.\n\nMy writing projects are really taking off now.  I am so pleased.  It is very fun to work on these projects.\n\n\n**Week of Nov 27**\n\nThis week was an intense week of work after a lot of time off.  We are trying to release the\nsoftware for the new watermills by the end of the year.  We had two big snow storms which affected\nthe travel to Frederick.  I worked at home on Thursday, and Eric called in paniced on Friday,\nwanting me to come to Frederick to fix bugs that he had just found in testing.  I had told him\nearlier that I would work on Friday, but had not yet started by noon.\n\nI learned enough Emacs lisp to be able to start automating basic commands. This is terribly exciting\nto me.  I have also mapped out a strategy for publishing multiple blogs and books.\n\nI had my second meeting with Tim Musslewhite this week. It was a bit tentative.  But I think we are\nstill working on finding the right way to interact.\n\nI realized that I really don't like the month of December.  I hate having to put up decorations and\nthe conflict that inevitably follows it.  I really dislike the issues with over spending, over\ncommitting, and extra demands that put way too much stress on everyone.  For me the main meaning of\nChristmas is conflict.  It reveals the greatest level of tension between Stacie and I.\n\nWe had our second meeting with the Hoods in Jordan.  God is putting together something very\nspecial.  We feel that we are really connecting with them.\n\nThe Windsor church leaders had a Christmas party at the Nardins' house.  There was a time during the\nparty where each person was able to share about what they really appreciated about someone else.  It\nwas very moving and encouraging.\n\n\n**Week of Nov 20**\n\nThis week was filled with great times to connect with both Eric Stanley and Josiah.  We shared ideas\nand stories about people that they were interacting with, and life experiences.\n\nThis week I launched the Dr Prof Tips newsletter and got my first 20 subscribers.  I got two books on\nblogging which were very helpful.  I also found out about the Octopress platform which is similar to\nMyBook.\n\nRick Olmstead announced this week that we will be focusing on reaching the next generation.  I am\nvery excited about that and am praying about what my role will be.\n\n\nSee also PrayerPractices,  [[Highlights]]\n", "user": 3, "title": "Weekly Highlights"}}, {"pk": 509, "model": "doc.doc",

How we spend those hours is important.  We can choose to\nspend those hours making money, or spent money to purchase time.  Either way there is a direct\nexchange between money and time.\n\nA life budget combines the concept of budgeting both money & time spending. If you have a full time\njob then you probably spend at least 2000 a year working. You do this so that you can earn money to\nspend time on the other things that you enjoy.\n\nSpending habits reflect the reasons why you work.  You can replace each dollar amount with the\nequivalent amount of time spent working to pay for it.  For example, if you spend $1000/month on a\nhouse payment and make $50/hour, then your house costs you 20 hours/month.\n\nHere's how it works. \n 1. Create a budget using last years actual spending, limiting yourself to six categories.\n 2. Convert the budget to time, where total dollars equals 2000 hours.\n 3. Create a weekly time budget, showing the six categories.  \n 4. Create an annual time budget for how you spend the 5000 hours each year  \n 5. Combine these to show work hours as percentages that match the money spent\n 6. Group these into large categories (us/them, work/play)\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nSee also [[Time]]\n", "user": 3, "title": "Life Budget"}}, {"pk": 540, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/Health", "time": "2014-06-15T20:37:48.675", "text": "* Health *                 -*-muse-*-\n\nWork on establishing practices for sustainable health\n\n**Weight**\n    weigh each morning\n    set weight limit to invoke austerity\n\n**Doctors**\n    primary physician yearly\n    dermatoligist yearly\n    dentist semi-annually\n\n**Excersize**\n    break for lunch and two 15 minute breaks at 10 & 3\n    walk one mile four times weekly\n    lift weights Tue, Thu\n\n**Mental health**\n    limit total work hours to 50\n    allocate time to projects\n    celebrate outcomes\n    plan variety within the work day\n    work on problem areas\n\n\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Health"}}, {"pk": 541, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/PerfectDay", "time": "2014-06-15T20:37:48.885", "text": "* Perfect Day *                 -*-muse-*-\nCharacteristics of a perfect day at work.\n\n**Relection**\nIt begins with a relaxed time of meditation and prayer.\nDuring this time I am able to reflect on activities from yesterday.\nExpectations are set for today\nCreate and process a list of things to think about\n\n**Planning**\nPlan each project (create a simple plan)\nPrioritization (prioritized list, time budget)\nCommunication (weekly report, monthly report)\nFollow up (interactions with team members)\n\n**Learning**\nLearn a new topic of interest\nExtend existing skills\nDevelop the process used for work\nBuild tools for maximum leverage\n\n**Testing**\nCreate a performance baseline\nFind all problems\nFix the most important problems\nBuild test tools\n\n**Inventing**\nIdentify the most important features\nTest-Driven Development\nRefactor & clean up\nFind leverage opportunities\n\n\n**Perfect Day Time Allocation**\n\n**Planning**    8-10\n    Plan each project\n    Prioritize\n    Communication\n    Follow up\n\n**Learning**    10-12\n    New topic\n    Extend skills\n    Process\n    Tools\n\n**Testing**     1-3\n    Baseline\n    Find problems\n    Fix  problems\n    Test tools\n\n**Inventing**   3-5\n    Prioritize features\n    TDD\n    Refactor\n    LeveragePerfectDay\n\n\nSee also [[Work]]\n\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Perfect Day"}}, {"pk": 542, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/FirstTechSurvey", "time": "2014-06-15T20:37:49.053", "text": "* First Tech Survey *                 -*-muse-*-\n\nSummary of our experience.\n\nWe decided to refinance our mortgage through our existing lender, First Tech.  The initial\napplication went well, but then the app fell into a black hole, weeks went by with no progress.  We\nexpected to close within a few day, but the whole process took months.\n\nThe underwriters kept asking for lots of useless information causing us to have to spend a large\namount of time filing information.\n\nThe worst experience happened, when we got a letter from First Tech saying that they could not find\nour insurance policy for a house we no longer owned.

Development Platforms and Tools**\nDjango\nASP.Net\nPHP\nJSP\nRails\n\nSelection Criteria:\n    Popularity - Mainstream development tool in top 3\n    Developer productivity\n    Scalability - to 1000 concurrent users\n    Reliability - proven track record\n    Familiarity - close to what I already know\n    Open source - no licensing fees\n    Mature - in at least the third generation\n    Support - lots of books and materials available\n    Futuristic - growing in popularity\n\n**Programming Languages**\nGo, Io, Closure\n\n\n**BOB MARTIN**\nWhy are we still talking about Xtreme programming after 10 years?\nScrum has caught on because it is palatable to business people\nScrum allows you to go faster, this can create a mess without the technical discipline\nTechnical debt is increased faster\nAgile shows the gap with flawed tech practices\nThere is a renewed interest in Craftsmanship\nCraftsmanship requires constant practice\nBoy Scout Rule - make things better, do no harm\nProgramming practices are adopted by people who want to be Craftsmen\n\n**AZURE WEB SERVICES**\nCloud computing - making services available by leveraging services from a leased data center\nRequests per second per machine 300-500 requests is typical (could be as low as 100)\nMain players (Amazon, Google App Engine, Microsoft Azure)\nAzure - OS in the cloud, provisioned on-demand, load-balanced\n\n**RESTful services**\nREST is simple and initially harder (but best in the long-term)\nSOAP is easy and complex (but can be harder in the long-term)\nYou get advantages from using each of the constraints of REST\n\nChoose simple (but hard) over complex (but easy)    \n\nExample:\n/doctors - Collection of doctors - GET, POST (create a new doc)\n/doctors/{id} - One doctor - GET, PUT, DELETE\n/doctors/{id}/reviews - Doctor's reveiws - GET, POST\n/reviews\n/reviews?search={searchTerm}\n/reviews/{id} \n/reviewers\n/reviewers/{id}\n\n**EMERGENT DESIGN**\nDesign is a way to reduce risk\nDesign is an intellectual and a practical pursuit\nWhen do we design?

How to live the good life. Greatest hits from the book of Proverbs.\n\n**God's direction:**\n\n    Trust in the Lord with all your heart; do not depend on your own understanding.\n\n    Seek his will in all you do, and he will show you which path to take.\n\n    We can make our own plans, but the Lord determines our steps.\n\n    The Lord directs our steps, so why try to understand everything along the way?\n\n    Commit your actions to the Lord, and your plans will succeed.\n\n    Don't be impressed with your own wisdom.  Instead, fear the Lord and turn away from evil.\n\n    Don't reject the Lord's discipline and don't be upset when he corrects you.\n\n**Wisdom:**\n\n    Guard your heart above all else, for it determines the course of your life.\n\n    Don't lose sight of common sense and discernment.  Hang on to them.\n\n    Get the truth and never sell it; also get wisdom, discipline, and good judgment.\n\n    Develop good judgment; getting wisdom is the wisest thing you can do!\n\n    The wise are mightier than the strong, and those with knowledge grow stronger and stronger. \n\n    Listen and be wise: Keep your heart on the right course.\n      \n    Commit yourself to instruction; listen carefully to words of knowledge.\n\n    Dont waste your breath on fools, for they will despise the wisest advice.\n\n    So dont go to war without wise guidance; victory depends on having many advisers.\n\n**Wealth:**\n\n    Honor the Lord with your wealth and with the best part of everything you produce.\n\n    Do your planning and prepare your fields before building your house.\n\n    Dont wear yourself out trying to get rich. Be wise enough to know when to quit.\n\n    Dont eat with people who are stingy; dont desire their delicacies.\n\n    Do not carouse with drunkards or feast with gluttons, for they are on their way to poverty.\n\n**Helping others:**\n\n    Do not withhold good from those who deserve it when it's in your power to help them.\n\n    If you can help your neighbor now; don't say, \"Come back tomorrow, and I will help you\".\n\n    Rescue those who are unjustly sentenced to die; save them as they stagger to their death. \n\n    Dont excuse yourself by saying, Look, we didn't know. For God understands all hearts, and he sees you.\n\n    Dont rejoice when your enemies fall; dont be happy when they stumble.\n\n    Dont fail to discipline your children. Physical discipline may well save them from death.\n\n    Dont testify against your neighbors without cause; dont lie about them.\n\n    Dont cheat your neighbor by moving the boundary markers; dont take the land of the defenseless.\n\n**Turn from evil:**\n\n    Don't plot harm against your neighbor, for those who live nearby trust you.\n\n    Don't pick a fight without reason, when no one has done you harm.\n\n    Look straight ahead and fix your eyes on what lies before you. Mark out a straight path for your feet. \n\n    Don't get sidetracked; keep your feet from following evil.\n\n    If sinners entice you, turn your back on them.  Don't go along with them! Stay far away from their paths.\n\n    Fools are destroyed by their own complacency.\n\n    Dont fret because of evildoers.\n\n    Don't envy violent people or copy their ways. Dont envy evil people or desire their company.\n\n    Dont envy sinners, but always continue to fear the Lord.\n \n\nSee also [[Prayer]]\n", "user": 3, "title": "Proverbs"}}, {"pk": 598, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/TurnKeyCore", "time": "2014-06-15T20:38:00.344", "text": "* Turn Key Core *                 -*-muse-*-\n\n*Virtual linux machine*\n\n**Goals & Benefits**\nCreate a portable VM of Linux server.\nUse on Sub to isolate native OS from build OS.\nAllow risk-free upgrade of OS on Sub.\nUse as a base for the VirtualBuildMachine\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**Steps**\n\nDownload Virtual Box software from web site\n -

The company\nspecializes in providing low cost, reliable hosting for Django applications.  Mike Hegdal setup the\nbusiness arrangement with Web Faction.   Login information can be obtained by contacting Mike.\n\nWe currently have two separate shared hosting accounts. The same server contains many user accounts.\n * wmexpress2@wmexpress2.webfactional.com - staging server\n * wmexpress@wmexpress.webfactional.com   - production server\n\nThe web site, database, and domain mappings are set up using a Web Faction control panel at\nhttps://my.webfaction.com .\n\nThe web site is visible at  http://wmexpress.webfactional.com.\n\n\n**Support Git**\n\nThe full contents of the web server are contained in version control.  Git repositories contain all\nversions of all files needed to fully reconstruct the entire history of the project.\n\nEach day all files are committed into the repository. Email is sent to the engineering staff for all\nfiles that are not committed. This makes us aware of everything that is happening automatically in\nthe system.\n\n\n**Server Setup Scripts**\n\nAll setup operations are controlled by a set of scripts.  Each script tends to be simple around five\nlines of bash script.  The script performs a single function.  The complex system can be quickly\ndecomposed into a set of simple building blocks for testing and trouble shooting.\n\n\n**Accounting**\n\nThe accounting data in the system is one of the most important aspects of the Support Server.  Each\nnight every mill must send a daily report to Support Server.  Each report is entered into the\ndatabase in the web application, named 'Support Center'.\n\nThese files are also archived as text files in Support Server directories.  This allows us to\ncompletely reconstruct the data that is currently in the database from the raw mill reports.  This\nis occasionally done when a problem is discovered with the web application.\n\n** Chapter 2 - Setup Hosting **\n\n**Account setup**\n\nThe staging and production servers are set up in two separate accounts at Web Faction. Access to\nthese accounts is done through ssh (secure shell).  This lets every operation be fully scripted to\nproduce the same results every time.\n\n\n**Watermill Inbox**\n\n We will need to set up a third account as an inbox that all of the mills can log into.   Each mill\n will contain a key that will allow them to authenicate themselve to the Watermill Inbox.  The inbox\n account will not allow any access to the Support Server.   Instead Support Server will reach in and\n grab files from this location.\n\n\n**Application setup**\n\nThe web application is written in Python.  It uses a web application framework called Django. The\napplication runs in the Apache web server.  The application uses a MySQL database to hold all of the\ndata tables.\n\n\n**Version control**\n\nAll of the application is stored in a Git repository.  A bare repository offers an endpoint for\npush and pull operations. This repository is housed at ssh://65.121.123.211/usr/local/support-git .\n\nThe database is saved each night as a SQL file.  This file is committed into the repository.  This\nwould let us track the history if it were to be important.\n\nAll data files (both input and output) are also committed into this repository.\n\n\n**Automated scripting**\n\nAll deployment is done with a single command from a development machine.  'sc-deploy' is used to\npush the current code to the staging server.   'sc-promote' is used to move the code from the\nstaging server to the production server.\n\nAll testing is performed daily by the script, 'sc-test'.   This runs a directory of scripts and\nsends email containing any unexpected results.\n\nNew problems discovered in the system should be fixed by extending the scripts to detect that\nparticular failure.  This means that over time every problem will be detected quickly and most\nproblems can be fixed automatically.\n\n\n** Chapter 3 - Application Logic\n\n**Mills, users, regions**\n\nThe Support Center web application is built to take care of watermills.  Each mill record defines\ninformation that is important for that mill.   The watermills are broken down by business needs into\nmarkets. \n\nEvery user in Support Center is assigned into a market.  Some users are assigned to the market\n\"none\" and others to \"all\".  Users in Support Center can only see field mills within their market.\nAll other mill data is hidden.\n\n\n**Alert processing**\n\nWhen a mill is malfunctioning it sends an Alert to Support Server.  This is a file containing the\nrecent history of bad things that happened.\n\nEach mill is assigned to a market.  Each user within that market can sign up to listen to all of the\nalerts for the mills in their market.\n\nAs each alert is processed within the Support Center application, an email may be sent out to the\ntechnicians and managers that have requested it.   Email notifications can be set up to send a text\nmessage to a telephone number, using an SMS gateway.\n\n\n**Accounting system**\n\nEach mill sends a daily report of sales, vends, and pricing.  These items are gathered into Support\nCenter and checked for validity.\n\nManagers can display the summary reports from this data.  This is useful for proofing the data and\nwatching the updates come through the system.\n\nEach day a report is sent that contains all of the sales, vends, and pricing data that was changed\nsince the last report.  This data is delivered to an FTP site for importing into wexnet.\n\n\n**Diagnostic tools**\n\nThere are many diagnostic tools that can be run from the server.  These scripts make it very\nconvenient to maintain a large number of watermills without having to log into each one\nindependently.\n\nThere are several high-level tools that allow many other tools to work.\n\n    sc-milldo - execute a single command on a mill and bring back the results\n    sc-millput - push a single file to a watermill\n    sc-millget - pull a single file from a watermill\n    sc-each-mill - do a command for each watermill in the field\n\nUsing these basic tools it is very easy to build a sophisticated system to do advanced tasks in a\nreliable way.  NOTE: Extreme caution should be used when performing operations across all field mills.\n\n\n** Chapter 4 - Data Import/Export\n\n**File import mechanism**\n\nAll of the data that comes from the watermill is a simple text file.  On the mill the file is\ndropped in the /root/to-brighton directory.  It is then send using scp to the\nsandbox@65.121.123.211:sandbox directory.  Then the file is moved to the /root/to-brighton-sent\ndirectory on the mill.\n\nNightly the /root/to-brighton directory on every mill is checked to make sure that the data is\nbeing moved.\n\nA script called 'handle-sandbox.sh' brings the data into the account for Support Server.   A script\ncalled 'handle-inbox' will import each data file into the Support Center application.\n\n\n**Alerts**\n\nThe alerts arrive as files in the inbox.  Each file contains a recent alert history from that mill.\nThis allows alert files to be lost without losing any of the history.  This is really useful when a\nmill is offline for an extended period.\n\n\n**Health monitoring**\n\nEvery hour each mill records its cumulative vend counts, nine pressure readings, and tank level.\nEach day these logs are all sent to Support Center.  \n\nThe data is put in tables and painted into web pages for Support Center users.  Each month this data\nis archived into CSV files that can be used creating analysis tools.\n\nWhen diagnosing a problem on a watermill it is often useful to update the web pages with information\nfrom today.  There is a link on the mill page that pull fresh data from the watermill.\n\n\n**Accounting data**\n\nEach day every mill sends cumulative receipts, cumulative vend counts, and prices to Support Center.\nAll of this data is put into cumulative data tables.  From these values the daily values are\ndetermined.  All of the records that are changed are saved in an export table.\n\nThe records from the export table are sent into a CSV file nightly and cleared from the export\ntable.  If the accounting has already been exported then this operation is not repeated, so that\ndata loss can be prevented.\n\n\n**Executor (for remote command execution)**\n\nThe web server runs as a separate user under Apache.  When it want to excute shell commands a call\nis made to the executor.  This script creates a command, runs it, and puts the results back into\nSupport Center.\n\nCommand execution is reliable and there is a full history of what happened.  This is especially\nimportant when executing commands on remote watermills that may not complete correctly.\n\n\n**File storage to reconstruct**\n\nThe following directory structure lets us reconstruct any story long after the situation happens.\n\ndata\n accounting\n  3002\n  3003\n  ...\n  3204\n  3297\n  3999\n archive\n  2011-01\n  2011-02\n  ...\n  2011-11\n  2011-12\n collection\n commands\n imported\n inbox\n  received\n  rejected\n logs\n  3090\n pending\n pricing\n  today\n sql\n test\n  accounting\n tmp\n\nThe way that this would normally happend would be to do a pull on the staging server.   This would\navoid any interruption of business on the production server.  The a 'git checkout' would let the\nengineer roll back to an earlier moment in time.  Both the database and files will be configured to\nthe situation that needs investigation.\n\n\n** Chapter 5 - Commander & automation\n\n**Support Center Command**\n\nSupport Center is a web site that has convenient access to a database. There is also a command-line\ninterface to get access to the database.   'scc' is a super-command that allows scripts to use\nSupport Center functionality.\n\nSupport Center Commands (scc) take automation to a higher level.  An engineer can create a script\nthat will do a sequence of operations applied to all of the mills in the field.  This make it easy\nto chain sequences of activies together.\n\nscc combined with the Linux toolbox makes for a world-class automation platform.  Operations that\ncould take a person many days to complete can now be done in minutes of thoughtful programming and\ntesting.  \n\n\n**File import filters**\n\nAll data comes into Support Center as files. The format of the filename describes the type of data\nthat is being imported.  Each data type is defined with a filename pattern and a handler that knows\nhow to read the records for that datatype.\n\nThe following data file formats are supported:\n\n    executor\n    account\n    alert\n    log\n    pressure\n    tank\n    vend\n    cmd\n    result\n    collection  \n\nEvery file that does not match any pattern is sent to the 'rejected' folder.  This folder is checked\nhourly to see if any files have landed there. \n\n\n**Server scripts**\n\nEverything in Support Server is controlled by scripts.  This means there are a lot of individual\ncommands to learn.  The place to start is with the 'sc-help' command.  This lists the available\nscripts with a one-line description.\n\nSearching  /home/seaman/wme/support-git/scripts\nacc-to-csv      # Convert a CSV file to a millcmd accounting file\ncsv-to-acc      # Convert a CSV file to a millcmd accounting file\nfiles.py        # Utilities for scripts\nsc-admin        # Show remote Support Center admin view\nsc-apache       # Restart the local development web server\nsc-archive-month # Archive monthly data\nsc-changes      # Show the Git status\nsc-check-accounting # Check to make sure that all of the daily accounting is correct\nsc-checkout     # Checkout the code on the production server \nsc-clean        # Clean out all the extra files\nsc-clear-inbox  # Clear the inbox folders\nsc-commands     # List Watermill commands\nsc-commit       # Commit all the outstanding files\nsc-control-panel # Go to the Support Center control panel\nsc-crontab      # Setup the crontab with tasks for Support Center\nsc-daily        # Run daily testing\nsc-deploy       # Deploy the staging server code\nsc-do           # Run a script on the staging server\nsc-download     # Download the archive files from the production server\nsc-each-mill    # Do the requested command on every mill\nsc-exe          # Create a new Support Center control script\nsc-forward-file # Forward a file to the Support Center inbox\nsc-get          # Get a file from the staging server\nsc-handle-inbox # Handle the inbox files\nsc-help         # List Watermill commands\nsc-hourly       # Run hourly testing\nsc-import       # Import a single data file\nsc-inbox        # List the contents of the inbox folders\nsc-init-price   # Initialize all of the pricing for all mills \nsc-initialize   # Create a new Support Center control script\nsc-ip           # Lookup the mill ip address\nsc-loaddb       # Create a new database from the command line\nsc-log          # Show the Support Center log\nsc-milldo       # Execute a script on the mill using 211 as a gateway server\nsc-millget      # Get a file from the mill using 211 as a gateway server\nsc-millput      # Put a file on the mill using 211 as a gateway server\nsc-money-convert # Convert the money tables\nsc-monthly      # Run monthly testing\nsc-newdb        # Create a new database from the command line\nsc-newgit       # Create a new git repo on the production server \nsc-put          # Put a file on the staging server\nsc-qt           # Support Center quick test\nsc-same-file    # Make sure that these files are the same\nsc-savedb       # Save the database from the command line\nsc-send         # Send email using the STMP at seaman@comsystem.us\nsc-show         # Show local Support Center\nsc-showdb       # Show database info\nsc-sql          # Create a new database from the command line\nsc-start-inbox  # Run the import file handler\nsc-stop-inbox   # Stop the handler for the inbox\nsc-term         # Support Center terminal\nsc-test         # Test all of the Support Center code\nsc-test-accept  # Capture all test output as correct\nsc-test-capture # Capture initial output from all tests\nsc-test-check   # Compare the last output with the correct output\nsc-test-filter  # Put the test output through a filter\nsc-test-output  # Capture all test output as correct\nsc-test-results # Compare the last output with the correct output\nsc-test-running # Make sure that Support Center is running\nsc-test-verify  # Run a command and check the output\nsc-todo         # Add an idea to the todo list\nsc-web          # Show local Support Center\nsc-weekly       # Run weekly testing\nscc             # Execute Support Center commands\n\nBefore running any script for the first time you must know what it will do.   Most of the scripts\nare very short and easy to read.  The fastest way to learn about a new script is to use 'show'\n(eg. 'show sc-test' or 'show sc-web'). \n\nIf you cannot figure out what a script will do after reading it them don't run it.  You should know\nthe result before you execute the command.\n\n\n** Chapter 6 - Testing\n\n**Unit testing**\n\nSupport Center is equipped with a full set of unit tests.  These test are embedded in the Support\nCenter Python code.  To run all of the unit test go to the Support Server Console and type 'scc\ntest'.  \n\nThis will create a new database for testing.  It will create all of tables needed by reading\nthe Django source code.  It will then perform all of the tests defined in the 'tests.py' files in\nSupport Center.\n\nIt will then list all of the errors, exceptions, and failed tests.  If any tests fail then they must\nbe fixed immediately.  Failing tests indicate that something unexpected is happening in the system.\n\nAfter all of the tests are complete the test database is removed.  All tests are performed outside\nof the data for the running system.\n\n\n**File import testing**\n\nThe most important feature of the Support Center web application is that it reads data that comes\nfrom the watermills.  All of this data is imported by a collection of file import filters.   Each of\nthese scripts knows how to read one type of data and use it to perform system operations.  See the\nsection on \"File import filters\" to see the list of supported file types.\n\nThe file import testing is done by reading in a set of known data files and checking to make sure\nthat Support Center does the correct things with them.  Each test is unique to what is being read.\nThese tests all add, remove, query and update the data in the live database. \n\nThe tests are written so that no disruptive operations are performed.  Modification are made only to\nthe records of test mill '3999' which is a virtual mill.  This protects the customer data from being\nchanged by the test.\n\nIn order for all of the file import testing to succeed everything has to work together perfectly.\nAlmost any change in the file import system will cause some test to fail.  When the tests pass there\nis a high degree of confidence in the inbox mechanism as well as the specific file imports.\n\n\n**Executor testing**\n\nAll Linux system commands are executed outside of the web server.  This protects the web server from\nhanging if a Linux command were to hang.  Support Center is capable of initiating system commands\nthat talk to mills or that manipulate the server computer system.\n\nExecutor is the mechanism that runs commands for the web server.  A command is written to the inbox\nand imported like any other file.  The command import filter starts the execution and attempts to\ncreate a corresponding results file.\n\nWhen a result file is imported the page that requested the command is rendered and returned to the\nweb user.   This mechanism prevents the web server from hanging to wait for long running commands.\nThe user running the browser will have to wait to get the results, but other users of the system\nwill not be blocked.\n\n\n**Overall testing**\n\nThe entire system can be tested by initiating the 'sc-test' command.  This will find a directory\nfilled with test scripts and run all of them.  Currently it takes six minutes to perform all tests.\n\nEach test has a file that contains the perfect output for that test.  This makes it extremely easy\nto write new tests.   When the test returns the exact output that was expected it is said to pass.\nIf anything else is returned, then the test fails.\n\nAt the end of the tests a summary of all of the failures is sent by email to the engineering staff\nfor evaluation.  Any failing tests should be fixed right away.   This prevents the bit rot that\nnormally happens on system, due to the changing world around the system.\n\nTo fix failing test, use the 'sc-test-results'.   This lists both the tests that failed and the\nspecific expected output for each of the failures.\n\nStart by understanding why the unexpected results appeared.  Is it a recent change?  Is it a test\nthat is to simple?   Is the test too critical?   Does it use today's data?\n\nCommon fixes include discarding certain output from the test, accepting the actual output as the new\ncorrect answer, or rethinking how the test is performed.\n\nThe power of this approach is that it is very easy to constantly extend the testing to cover new\nsituations. Each time new functionality is added then a new test can be added to ensure that the\nfunction is working in its basic form.\n\nIf this system is used properly it will guarantee that everything will continue to work well all the\ntime. To encourage this, the 'sc-test' command is run automatically each day with email sent to the\nengineer staff.\n\n\n**Checkup system**\n\nEach morning at 3:00 the checkup script is run.  This will perform a full test of the Support\nServer.  It will also do regularly scheduled maintenance tasks that are needed (eg. backup, log\nrotation, disk space management).\n\nEach of the field mills also has special support tasks that must be done.  The script\n'sc-checkup-mill' is run to do testing and maintenance of a single mill.   'sc-each-mill' is used to\nrun the checkup on every watermill in the system.\n\n\n** Chapter 7 - Mill diagnostics\n\n**Diagnostics from server**\n\nThere are many diagnostic tools that can be run from the server.  These scripts make it very\nconvenient to maintain a large number of watermills without having to log into each one\nindependently.\n\nThere are several high-level tools that allow many other tools to work.\n\n    sc-milldo - execute a single command on a mill and bring back the results\n    sc-millput - push a single file to a watermill\n    sc-millget - pull a single file from a watermill\n    sc-each-mill - do a command for each watermill in the field\n\nUsing these basic tools it is very easy to build a sophisticated system to do advanced tasks in a\nreliable way.  NOTE: Extreme caution should be used when performing operations across all field mills.\n\n\n**Mill monitor**\n\nThere are currently three types of data that are logged on the watermills hourly.  This data is sent\nfrom the mill and cleared daily.  Each of these are logged hourly to analyze time-of-day trends.\n\n    vends - all nine product vend counts \n    pressure - during idle, ro, flush  -- readings of input, ro feed, ro pressure\n    tank  - tank level in gallons\n\n\n**MCP**\n\nAnother tool to debug watermills is MCP (mill control program). This program is run by logging into\na console window on the watermill.  This is a text based program that can be used to view values and\nchange a few of them.\n\n\n**Diagnostics**\n\nAll of the diagnostics are located on the server and distributed nightly to all of the watermills.\nThere are different types of mills so the script 'push-diagnostics' is able to determine the\ndiagnostics that are needed on a given mill.\n\nNOTE: This feature is currently disabled because of the pending roll of both old and new\nwatermills.  It will be enabled once the roll is complete.\n\n\n** Chapter 8 - Support process and training\n\n**Support Sever Operations**\n\nThis document describes how to use Support Center to accomplish various support tasks.  It is\nwritten for helping the users of Support Center know what to do.\n\n\n**Support Server Design**\n\nThis document describes the engineering view of Support Server and the embedded Support Center web\napplication, and scripts.  It is important to thoroughly understand this document in order to modify\nany of the components within Support Server.\n\n\n**Tech Notes**\n\nSupport Center contains an embedded system for displaying and editing technical notes.\n\n\n** Chapter 9 - Development process\n\n**Automated testing**\n\nManual testing is very expensive.  Typically it is used to \"poke around\" to see if anything is\nbroken.  For a system as complex as Support Server most problems will not be found with this type of\ntesting.  Our history has been that some problems have hidden in the system for months before\ndiscovery. Unknown problems in a system can be very costly.\n\nAutomatic tests can be performed daily (or hourly if needed).  This is the only cost-effective way to \nkeep a system like Support Server functioning properly.\n\nThe key to using automatic testing is to fix every failing test immediately.  It is tempting to\nignore a failing test, but the will result in a much worse problem occurring.\n\nThere are five unique types of automated tests done within Support Server: file imports, executor,\nunit tests, sc-test, system checkup.   Each of these testing types will reveal certain problems.\nEach of these test will require maintenance.\n\n\n**Develop and test locally**\n\nAll development should be performed on an isolated computer system.   The 'support-git' repository\ncontains a full set of files to create a full self-contained server.  In only requires an Ubuntu\ninstallation with Apache, MySql, and Django installed.\n\n    sc-help - Show me useful commands\n    sc-changes, sc-commit, sc-push - Used to manage changes locally\n    sc-test - Run all automatic test (don't push without running this first)\n    sc-apache - Run the local app within Apache\n\n\n**Deploy on staging server**\n\nWhen the code has been tested and committed on the development machine it can be fully deployed onto\nthe staging server with a single command.\n\n    sc-deploy - Push and pull from the staging server, restart Apache\n    sc-staging-term - From a dev machine show a terminal window\n    sc-staging-web - From a dev machine show the Support Server web page\n    sc-test - Run all of the automatic tests on the staging server (run on wmexpress2)\n\n\n**Deploy on production server**\n\nAfter the code is thoroughly tested and reviewed then it can be promoted from the staging server to\nthe production server.\n\n    sc-promote - Deploy the current code on the production server (always run from staging)\n    sc-web - From a dev machine show the Support Server web page\n\n\nSee also SupportCenterOperation \n\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Support Center Design"}}, {"pk": 606, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/PasswordManagement", "time": "2014-06-15T20:38:01.898", "text": "* Password Management *                 -*-muse-*-\n\nAll passwords are saved in a universal file using Keepass.  \n\nKeypass is installed on each computer and the data file is replacated.\n\nAll passwords are generated using a standard algorithm which is switched once a year.\n\nEach password is reset each year.\n\n\nSee also ComputerSetup, DataManager\n\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Password Management"}}, {"pk": 607, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/BookNotes", "time": "2014-06-15T20:38:02.120", "text": "* Book Notes *                 -*-muse-*-\nNotes for great books I've read\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\n**9 Things You Simply Must Do**\n\nThe way that people live determines success.\n\n1.

Sit down and describe your ideal life\nsituation of three years from now.  This is not a plan but a target.\nWhat would you life your life to be like in three years?\n\nWhy three years?  It is close enough that it demands immediate\naction. But there is also enough time to accomplish something\nmeaningful. A five year goal may not be very realistic because there\nis a feeling that anything in possible.  A one year goal, on the other\nhand, is so immediate that it is not possible to dream.\n\nThree years is enough time to create meaningful change.  The question\nis, \"What direction do you want the change to be in?\".  This should be\nan expression of your values.  What things drive you at your core?\n\nAt this point in my life I value autonomy, mastery, and purpose.\nThese three core values were first articulated for me in the book\n\"Drive\", by Daniel Pink.  But they have resonated with me for a long time.\n\nA target for my life three years from now, would need to embrace all\nthree of these dimensions. Before describing the ideal situation,\nlet's explore each of these three dimensions.\n\n**Autonomy**\n\nFor much of my life I had to work to meet the expectations of others.\nThis was a natural consequence of having responsibility for the\nwelfare of my family.  Now that they are grown I am able to take on\nmore professional risks.\n\nI have also spent thirty years building technical experience and\nfinancial strength to weather the inevitable turmoil to come.  Life is\nwhat happens when you are busy making other plans.\n\nHaving consistently invested for three decades has put me in a strong\nbargaining position from a career, financial, and relational\nviewpoint.  Now it is time to experience the benefit of that.\n\nI want a life situation that lets me choose what I work on, when I\nwork, and who I work with.  I love thinking about projects and intend\nto work hard on them.  But this must be internally motivated rather\nthan forced by the expectations of others.\n\nI have worked hard to achieve this position, and now I am already in a\nposition to control the terms of by career.  The biggest challenge\nfor me is to not sell this freedom for some other benefit.\n\n**Mastery**\n\nI see myself as an inventor, software developer, and author.  From\nchildhood I have been fascinated by inventing things.  I love learning\nand teaching others.  My whole adult life has been a quest for\nachieving mastery of the process of developing software.\n\nOver the last few years, I have been making more time to write.\nReading is a very important part of my life.  I have the largest\npersonal library of anyone I know.  As I learn more I feel compelled\nto pass that knowledge on to others.\n\nOver the last few years I have begun to develop daily practices of\nwriting. I have been learning more about the process of writing and\nhow to tell a good story.  Someday I hope to be a strong writer with a\nfollowing of people who anticipate the next update.\n\nI love computers (except when they break).  Software development is an\nintensely human activity.  It is a chance to create an entire world\ninside of a computer.  I have been very fascinated by the mechanics of\nthe process of software creation.  I want to thoroughly understand and\nteach what makes great software.\n\n**Purpose**\n\nI think that purpose is about serving others.  It is about meeting the\nneeds of someone else.  Sure we have to meet our own needs but that is\nnot enough.  We each must have a feeling that we are producing more\nthan we are consuming.\n\nAt the end of my life I must be able to point to my career and see\nthat I contributed much more than I was ever paid.  I must be able to\nlook at the lives of the people that loved me most and realize that\ntheir lives were much fuller for knowing me.\n\nFinally purpose for me is about knowing that I have changed the\nworld. I need to know that things that I have said have been heard,\nand that things that I have done have made a difference.\n\nThis comes to the issue of influence.  Have I led others to a deeper\nunderstanding of truth?  Are others inspired by my example to a\ngreater level of sacrifice?  These are the questions that cause me to\nlay awake at night.\n", "user": 3, "title": "My Perfect Life"}}, {"pk": 615, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/BalancePoint", "time": "2014-06-15T20:38:03.589", "text": "* Balance Point *                 -*-muse-*-\n\nFind the right balance, rather than slam the wall.\n\nShort term      -- Long term\nDo it fast      -- Do it right\nProductivity    -- Quality\nPay me now      -- Pay me later\n\nTasks           -- Tools\nDo the step     -- Automate it\nDoing           -- Learning\n\nWatermill code  -- Support Center\nWrite code      -- Testing\nFeatures        -- Infrastructure\n\nWork for Client -- Work for Company\nMy needs        -- Your needs\nResults         -- Fun\nTasks           -- People\nProduction      -- Marketing\n\nPessimism       -- Optimism\nHonesty         -- Peace keeping\n\nPublic          -- Private\nStriving        -- Resting\n\nControl         -- Freedom\nYang            -- Yin\n\nSee also LifeBudget\n\n                    []         []\n                    -------------\n                          ^\n                         /_\\\n", "user": 3, "title": "Balance Point"}}, {"pk": 616, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/SimpleAppsWork", "time": "2014-06-15T20:38:03.780", "text": "* Simple Apps Work *                 -*-muse-*-\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n \n**Share**\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\n    meet weekly*\n    track time and task*\n    document user stories*\n    Trello tasks*\n    send email*\n    weekly story*\n\n    resume collection\n    plan out communication\n    ask for response\n    create business portal content\n    create staging area\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\n**Done**\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\n    build a user story development process UserStoryProcess\n    create account at Web Faction\n    create Hammer application\n    create user registration process\n    create system test\n    create wiki formatting\n    create method for adding and editing pages\n    template cloning user story\n    automatic document control\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\n**To Do**\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\n**Test** - verify\n\n**Fix** - defects\n    name change in code to App Thumper\n\n**Extend** - features \n    setup dns server\n    build __App__ content docs\n    User Guide\n\n**Improve** - structure\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\n**USERS**\n\tmark.sluss48@gmail.com\tMark Sluss\t\n\tronz@codegeek.net\t\tRon Zasadzinski\t\n\tseaman                  Mark Seaman         mark@seamanfamily.org\t \t \t\n\tsofar1121@gmail.com\t\tStephanie Farrell\t\n\n\nSee also SimpleApps\n\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Simple Apps Work"}}, {"pk": 617, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/Doctors", "time": "2014-06-15T20:38:03.971", "text": "* Doctors *                 -*-muse-*-\n\n**schedule Dr appointment:**\n    dr.

*                 -*-muse-*-\n\nEach person has several talent themes that can be both a strength and a weakness.  These are\ndiscribed in detail in \"Strength's Finder 2.0\".  One of the talent themes is called Achiever.  This\ncompells a person to accomplish great things with a high energy level.\n\nBut it can also give people a value of self-worth that is determined by what they have accomplished\nin the last day.  One of the significant weaknesses of the Achiever talent is that it is difficult\nto sense satisfaction in acheivements.  The thrill disipates very quickly.\n\nThis makes it essential for people with Achiever to find ways to extend the enjoyment for past\naccomplishments. One practice that I have found helpful is to celebrate the successes. If there is\nnot a conscious pratice of celebration, then the Achiever will naturally be drawn into a despondency\nover what was not done.\n\nI find it all but impossible to enjoy the accomplishments of the past while still dealing with the\nchallenges of the future.  New goals quickly eclipse old ones.  Past deeds are immediately replaced\nby new unmet demands.  Celebration can break this downward spiral.\n\nThis form of celebration has several distinct parts:\n\n**recall** - make a list of everything that was done, or was was learned along the way\n\n**organize** - group things together into themes and extract the key learning\n\n**dream** - about where you would like to take this accomplishment in the future\n\n**share** - your ideas with others that can appreciate what you did\n\n**prioritize** - assess how important this accomplishment is relative to other possible investments\n\nConsider doing this type of activity, monthly, quarterly, and yearly.  This will energize other\nactivities you do.  You might set aside a whole day once a quarter to review your past achievements\nand plan new ones.  Celebration should play a central role in this type of planning.\n\nSee also PersonalRetreat\n\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Celebrate Accomplishments"}}, {"pk": 626, "model": "doc.doc", "fields":

Commit to 1 hour per day and youre able to write 2 pages per\nhour. To write a short book of 100 pages will take 50 days. 100 pages per book/2 pages per hour, or\n50 hours.\n\n**250 words per page** is generally considered to be standard. \n\nManuscriptLength\nThis standard was set in earlier times, when most manuscripts were prepared on typewriters with\nfixed pitch (monospace) fonts. Even though times have changed, and many more fonts and text options\nare now available to the writer, the old guideline of 250 words per page is still the norm.\n\n\"Publishers' word count requirements were set up back in the days of typewriters when Courier was\nthe only option. Therefore, word counts are still based on the standards of 25+ years ago. Most\npublishers these days will accept manuscripts in any clear, easily readable font, but there is a\nlingering belief among certain authors that only Courier is acceptable for manuscripts...\n\nMany category editors find it easier to judge the length of a book in the way they've always done:\nknowing exactly how many book pages a manuscript of, say, 200 pages in Courier at 250 words per page\nis going to translate into when it becomes a finished product.\n\nIn actuality, however, most editors now accept Times New Roman since it is the 'default' font on\nmost personal computers. (Also, it saves a tree due to using less paper.) I've also heard from\nvarious authors, via e-mail loops, that they use other fonts. The 'must' is that the font be easy\nfor an editor to read... IMPORTANT: Whatever font you decide to use, you will need to experiment to\nfind out how many pages your manuscript would have been if written in Courier, as this is the only\nway you will be able to accurately compare your word count to the publishers'...\n\nWHITE SPACE. Manuscripts are counted by page rather than computer word count because authors write\nwith varying amounts of 'white space'...  It's possible a page with a good deal of narrative might\ncontain 300+ words, while a page with lots of short dialogue might be not more than 200. Therefore,\nthe editor has to think in terms of number of pages, not the number of words.\"\n\nBlair Bancroft: Word Count\nhttp://www.blairbancroft.com/word_count.htm\n\n\"Word count: based on 25 lines per page in Courier New 12 pt. averages approximately 250 words per\npage. 20 pages, an average chapter, =25,000; 200 pages=50,000; 400 pages=100,000; 600 pages=150,000;\n800=200,000 words. Most books are between 50 and 100,000 words long.  Publishers estimate by pages,\nincluding the white space. A computer count of 50,000 words may be 65,000 in publishers' terms. If\nyou use a computer word count note it on the front of the ms.\"\n\nDaphne Clair/Laurey Bright: Approaching a publisher  \nhttp://homepages.paradise.net.nz/dclair/approachingeds.html\n\n\"Page Counts In most cases, industry standard preferred length is 250 words per page... so a 400\npage novel would be at about 100,000 words. If you want to see what size book is selling in your\ngenre, take a look on the shelves. If the average length is 300 pages, you're looking at a 75,000\nword manuscript (approximately).\"\n\nFiction Factor: How Long Should Your Story Be?\nhttp://www.fictionfactor.com/articles/wordcount.html\n\n**manuscript word count** used by editors for counting standard pages (250 words/page)\n\n  1 page       250 words \n100 pages   25,000 words \n200 pages   50,000 words \n300 pages   75,000 words \n500 pages  125,000 words\n\nhttp://harris-donahue.tripod.com/id4.html\n\n\nSee also PageCount\n\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Manuscript Length"}}, {"pk": 649, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/WatermillProjects", "time": "2014-06-15T20:38:10.174", "text": "* Watermill Projects *                 -*-muse-*-\n\n\n**Meeting with Eric**\nmilestones 2012\n    move server code to hosted server\n    reproducible software process\n    restructure and expand all code\n    build automatic maintenance platform\n    build a support team\n    \nprojects\n    file management and hosting\n    diagnostic platform\n    integration with other systems\n    management of support projects\n    \ndesign review of Support Server Automation\n    multiple servers, multiple branches\n    tests\n    problem reports\n    scripts and sc command\n    file management\n\nintegrate Eric's diagnostics into Support Server framework\n\n\n**Watermill Server Projects**\n\nI am currently splitting my time between doing field support work and enhancing the functionality of\nthe watermill server.\n\nRoutine tasks are being transferred to Dean once the steps are predictable.

True faith is not about\nan abstract belief but a tangible trust in You. I know intellectually that You are powerful and\ngood. But I am also a corrupted man, and I am compelled by sin to try to go my own way. Help me,\nJesus, to yield to Your ways and means.

The app's strong suits are that it's fast, super easy, and cross-platform\n (the Linux version is available in the forums.) Plus, the app preserves all of the source disc's\n information, including tracks, chapters, HD audio, menus, and so on. The app is completely free. \n\nHandbrake (Win/OS X/Linux) http://handbrake.fr/\n\nHandbrake is our favorite video encoder for a reason: it's simple, easy to use, easy to install, and\noffers a wealth of tweaking options to get the best possible file as a result. If you're daunted by\nthem, you don't even have to use themthe app will compensate for you and pick some settings it\nthinks you'll like based on your destination device. So many of you like Handbrake that many of you\nuse it in conjunction with another appyou'll let another app do the rip and crack the DRM on your\ndiscs, and then process the file through Handbrake for encoding. The app is fast, can make the most\nof multi-core processors to speed up the process, and is completely open source.

Here is the model that I am currently using.  I believe it to be pretty accurate.\n\nA complex system can really be decomposed into a set of discrete task.  Each task solve a unique\ntechnical problem.  Every task has two parts (learning, and doing).  Each task that requires about\nan hour of engineering, on average, once the process is fully understood.\n\n**Learning vs. Doing**\n\nA competent engineer can learn a new trick in about a day.  Each time a trick is performed the\nlearning time for that trick is cut in half.  After about four times the task is automated or super\neasy to repeat.\n\nA complex system can be estimated by estimating the sum of the effort of the tasks.  Each task is\ncalculated to be 1 hour plus 8 hours for each new trick to learn.  I also use partial learning\ncredits of 2 hours and 4 hours for tasks that have been done rarely.\n\n**System Scope**\n\nThere are four distinct parts to creating a web application.  Each of these aspects can present\nunique engineering problems.  A task breakdown should be done for each aspect to create an estimate.\n\nI try to use technologies that are already familiar to eliminate the required learning.  Here's how\nI would estimate the following using familiar technologies\n\nSetup Hosting \n     Account setup - 1 hour \n     Application setup - 1 hour \n     Version control - 1 hour \n     Automated scripting - 1 hour\n\nApplication Logic\n     Scales by data type - 3 hours/type (add, modify, find)\n    * Typical web application involves about 10 data types\n     Each data type requires storage and views for CRUD ops\n     Application framework - URLs, views, models, etc. - scales by type\n     Gather user content - no time budgeted for this\n\nData Import/Export\n     How does data enter and leave the system?\n     File import/export operations\n     Email interfaces\n     Transactions on web service\n     Estimate using the 1 hour + learning model\n\nTesting\n     Unit testing - all functionality should be automatically tested - 2 hours\n     File import testing via scripted interface - 2 hours\n     Overall testing - 2 hours\n     Checkup system - embedded self test - 2 hours\n\n**Summary**\n\nSetup Hosting       - 4 hours - 36 hours the first time \nApplication Logic   - 30 hours - 150 hours if learning new technology \nData import/export  - 4 hours - 36 hours if learning \nTesting - 8 hours   - 64 hours to learn\n\nTotal investment - 42 hours with no learning - 300-400 hours with learning everything\n\nThis matches my actual experience with learning several new platforms.\n\n**Eliminating the Learning Curve**\n\nOne thing that comes from this analysis is the need to eliminate the learning curve.  Any good\nprogrammer can learn to do what is required to complete any job.  But the cost effectiveness is\nbased on how many times each trick has been performed.\n\nThe primary choice of technology is not based on the inherent effectiveness of the technology, but\non the actual effectiveness of the individual using it.  I believe that the differences between any\ntwo technologies is a second-order effect.\n\nA well trained engineer using .Net, Django, JSP, or PHP, will produce about the same level of\noutput.  There is no silver bullet.\n\nThe thing to avoid is climbing a new learning curve, unless you plan on getting a long-term benefit\nfor it.\n\n\nSee also WorldClassSoftware\n\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Software Estimation"}}, {"pk": 677, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/PresidentsDay", "time": "2014-06-15T20:38:15.724", "text": "* Presidents Day *                 -*-muse-*-\nannual financial records day   2014-02-17\n\n\n**Done**\n\n\n**Active**\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\n**Tax Preparation Checklist**\nupdate plan for creating tax records\ndownload all statements (wf-family, wf-business, first tech)\ncreate text files for receipt lists\nimport to spreadsheets\nappointment with Diane\ncreate process for next year\n\n**Records**\n\nbank statements \n    Wells Fargo SWS Visa\n    Wells Fargo SWS Checking\n    Pay Pal\n\nincome \n    invoices: watermill, semantic, core, cne\n    interest: wells fargo, first tech, merryll lynch\n    investments: merryll lynch, first tech\n    tax refund\n\nbusiness expenses \n    workers\n    computers\n    office supplies\n    utilities (comcast, verizon)\n    isp (joyent, host gator, godaddy, meetup, aweber, ..)\n    training (pycon, safari)\n\ndonations\n    vineyard\n    e3\n    cup of hope\n    convoy\n    sim\n\nfind money related email messages\nmileage/meals\nhouse insurance and tax\ntax paid (sws, banner)\n\n**Secure Docs**\ncreate new key for secure docs\nmove docs to new key\nconvert old files\nupdate commands to pack and unpack\nupdate docs within git structure\n\n**Invoice**\ncheck on Bryan time\ngather time\nprepare invoice\n\n**Bills**\npaper pile\nbill pay\nbank balances\nreview of money data\n\n**Processing Scripts**\nexpenses-bank SWS-Checking\nexpenses-bank SWS-Checking\nexpenses-pdf SWS-Visa\nexpenses-income SWS-Receipts.csv\n\n**Spreadsheet**\ncut and paste\nSWS-Checking\nSWS-Visa\nSWS-cash\nSWS-Income\n\n**Summary Tables**\n\nTax 2014 sheet\n    Revenue            145,404\n\n    Total expenses      23,725\n    Expenses            10,511\n    Special expenses     5,217\n    Subcontracting       7,997\n\n    Tax payments        30,926\n\nCombine all tables \nConvert + for income  - for expenses\nRemove tax neutral transactions\n\n\nSee also [[Taxes]]\n", "user": 3, "title": "Presidents Day"}}, {"pk": 678, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/ROI", "time": "2014-06-15T20:38:15.928", "text": "* ROI *                 -*-muse-*-\n\n*Estimating the return for tools*\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**Return**\nExpected return to build tool or knowledge.\n\n * High   - Greater than 100 hours\n * Medium - 10 -- 100 hours\n * Low    - Less than 10 hours\n\n**Investment**\nExpected time to build tool or knowledge.\n\n * High   - Greater than 40 hours\n * Medium - 4 -- 40 hours\n * Low    - Less than 4 hours\n\n**Types of ROI**\n 1.

I ask that you would watch over Josiah and\nSam.  Keep them secure in your plan.  Let them focus on the important issues of life in front of\nthem and help them to understand how to have a sustainable lifestyle.\n\nThank you for what you have done in both of their lives.  Thank you for the blessing that they have\nbecome to Stacie and me. We have been able to see your grace operating within them, to bring them to\nthe point they are at now. We know that you will continue to be faithful to them.\n\nGod, bless and preserve their health. Restore Josiah's broken arm to its full strength. Help Sam to\nfeel better and the baby to grow and thrive.  Bring relief to Josiah from the migraines he struggles\nwith. \n\nProtect them from any financial tragedy from not having insurance. Allow Josiah and Sam to move into\ntheir new home in Loveland, even though Josiah has a broken arm.\n\nHelp Josiah to concentrate enough on his school work to be sucessful.  Give him the ability to pass\nthe prelim assignment so that he can begin serious work on his thesis.\n\nLet the fullness of your love surround them.  Let your plan for their lives be fully accomplished in\nthem. Bring glory to yourself through their lives.  May your kingdom be demonstrated in them.\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**Marriage Improvement** - Jan 2011\n\nStacie and I have a wonderful marriage.  But I am regularly blindsided by the issues that linger\nunresolved for years. We need a way to identify the emotional needs that drive each of us and\nnegotiate how they can be met.  We need a plan for regular work on our marriage.\n\nIt is easy for me to assume that Stacie is just like me.  This is a very flawed assumption based on\nher many similarities.  We still have many areas where our fundamental assumptions  about things are\ndifferent. This could actually be a strength for us, if we learn to honor those differences.\n\nLord show us where to start.  Help us begin a deeper journey to connect with each other.  I want you\nto be at the center of our relationship.  Draw us closer together.\n\nI confess that I consistantly demand my own selfish way and neglect to look at things from Stacie's\nviewpoint.  I often ignore her needs, while carefully guarding and cultivating my own. Grant me both\nthe desire and power to change.\n\nGive us a means of talking about these issues that is constructive and life-giving.  Make us one in\nspirit and purpose.  Cause us to fall in love all over again.\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**Christmas Blues** - Dec 2011\n\nI recently realized that December is a really tough month for me.  Stacie's expectations create a\ngreat deal of anxiety in me.  The natural differences that we have seem to be accentuated during\nthis time of year.  Conflict is at a annual high, during this season of good will.\n\nI don't enjoy the same activities as Stacie, and this creates tension in our relationship.  There\nare high expectations for social activities and conflict over how to spend money.  I always feel\nlike a reluctant participant in these activities. Then I feel guilty for not wanting to take part or\nfor not enjoying it like I should.\n\nI feel bullied and like a second rate person who can't appreciate the true meaning of Christmas.\nStacie frequently compares me to members of my family that I know that she does not respect.  I\ncan't wait for January to get here when I can get back to normal.\n\nIt is strange to have our anniversary at this time of year.  Maybe it is good timing to pause and\nreflect about the true nature of our relationship when we are feeling so raw and exposed.\n\nLord, help me to see this time of year through your eyes.  Help me to embrace the brokenness that I\nfeel rather than simply hide from it.  Help me to be kind and loving even when I don't want to be.\nShow me how to resolve my own personal issues without driving others crazy.\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**Concern for Christine** - Nov 2011\n\nChristine has not developed in her personal life.  She is smart enough, but completely disabled\nemotionally.  It is likely that she will never be able to care for herself or have meaningful\nrelationships with others. She lacks motivation, confidence, and hope for the future.  I have no\nidea how to help her.  Communication about these subjects is completely fruitless and frustrating.\n\nLord give me courage to even look at this area of my life.  I am so frustrated about it that I\nsystematically avoid all thinking about it.  I completely shutdown emotionally because I feel so\nhelpless.\n\nHelp me to see Christine as you see her.  I know that you have placed her in our family on purpose.\nShe plays a role in our lives and we play a role in hers.  Please give me more understanding about\nwhat that role is.\n\nIf I will ever be able to play a part in helping her I must first embrace your presence in this area\nof my life. Transform my heart and mind.  Give me you insights so that I can be changed at the core.\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nSee also PrayerPractices\n", "user": 3, "title": "Prayer Journal"}}, {"pk": 697, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/SocialNetworkLinks", "time": "2014-06-15T20:38:19.351", "text": "* Social Network Links *                 -*-muse-*-\n\n** Facebook **\n\nInclude the JavaScript SDK on your page once, ideally right after the opening <body> tag.\n\n<div id=\"fb-root\"></div>\n<script>(function(d, s, id) {\n  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;\n  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;\n  js.src = \"//connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js#xfbml=1\";\n  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);\n}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));</script>\n\n\nPlace the code for your plugin wherever you want the plugin to appear on your page.\n\n<div class=\"fb-like\" data-href=\"\" data-send=\"false\" data-width=\"225\" data-show-faces=\"false\"></div>\n\n** Google Plus 1 **\n\n<!-- Place this render call where appropriate -->\n        <script type=\"text/javascript\">\n          (function() {\n          var po = document.createElement('script'); po.type = 'text/javascript'; po.async = true;\n          po.src = 'https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js';\n          var s = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0]; s.parentNode.insertBefore(po, s);\n          })();\n        </script>\n\n\n <!-- Add the following three tags inside head -->\n      <meta itemprop=\"name\" content=\"Seaman's Log\">\n      <meta itemprop=\"description\" content=\"Helping you thrive in the modern world.\">\n      <meta itemprop=\"image\" content=\"http://markseaman.org/media/mybook/images/Mark.Seaman.200.jpg\">\n\nSee also SeamansLog\n\n\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Social Network Links"}}, {"pk": 698, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/WatermillRules", "time": "2014-06-15T20:38:19.547", "text": "* Watermill Rules *                                                                        -*-muse-*-\n\nThe new Support Center makes it easy to check that certain business rules.  In the past we had an\nopen-loop system.  Watermills report data daily and this information is automatically passed on with\nonly rudimentary checking performed.  This required that people be watching the system to catch\nerrors.\n\nThe new system has a general-purpose rule checker built in.  This makes it very easy to setup rules\nthat must always be true.  Nightly and hourly there are test scripts that run to ensure that all of\nthe data in the system is valid.  The import filters for each type of data also run many of these\nrules before the data is added to the tables.\n\nIf any rule is violated then the exception is sent to the engineering staff at Watermill (currently\nMark Seaman). This email will result in an investigation.  \n\nCertain violations will be \"normal\" operation of the system.  These will be turned into alerts and\nsent to the Watermill Operations Staff for normal handling.\n\nThere will be a transition period as we turn on detectors for all of these business rules.\nInitially I expect the system to flag many issues.  Some will be false alarms, and some will point\nup real flaws in the system that have caused us much heartache.\n\nThe new tools will allow us to trace problems to their root cause very quickly.

It is used to get and set live\ndata values on a running mill.\n\nMill Probe is a tool that can be used from a remote computer to interrogate a watermill.  This\ncreates a remote access for the 'millcmd' data in a watermill.\n\nMill Probes only support getting the data values for security reasons.\n\n\nHow does it work?\n\nThe mill probe system is made up of several different components that work together.  Each part of\nthe system is very simple, but together the system is quite sophisticated.  The components are:\n\n * Mill Probe Server\n * Mill Probe Script\n * Probe Command\n * Mill Command\n * Node.JS\n * Probe HTML\n\n\nMill Probe Server\n\nThis application runs on each watermill.  It provides a web service interface to answer queries.  It\nuses a URL to request that a particular Mill Probe Script be run on the watermill.  \n\nExample:\n    http://65.121.123.216:3002/pressure\n    This url requests that the pressure script be run on the watermill located at 65.121.123.216.\n    The results are gathered and returned as a web response.\n\n\nMill Probe Script\n\nOn each watermill there are scripts that contain a list of millcmd variables.  Each script is a mill\nprobe.  Each script can be invoked by executing it on the remote watermill.\n\nExample:\n    sc-milldo 3006 'millcmd probe/pressure'\n\n\nProbe Command\n\nOn the watermill support servers (production, staging, development) a probe command can be\nexecuted. This command when find the appropriate probe to be executed on the requested unit.  This\nis based on the software version running on the requested unit.\n\nThe probe command is executed remotely by sending the correct web request to the Mill Probe Server\non the watermill.  The results are then returned as a text file to the caller.\n\nExample:\n    sc-probe 3006 pressure\n\n\nMill Command\n\nThis command lives on the watermill.  It does the actual variable lookup on the live mill.  Results\nare returned as text.\n\nExample:\n    millcmd presssure.mc\n\n\nNode.JS\n\nThe Mill Probe Server is a lightweight web server that is built using a server-side JavaScript\nlibrary, called Node.JS.  This is an extremely efficient way to create a web server that does\nsomething simple.  Each watermill must have Node.JS installed.\n\nExample:\n    apt-get install nodejs\n\n\nProbe Definition\n\nEach probe is defined by a list of variables for millcmd and labels to show them in english.  When\nexecuted on a watermill each value is read from the Mill Probe Server.  Then the value is formatted\nby the matching string to display it in a friendly way.\n\nExample:\n    label_map = {\n        'production.tankLevel.state.fillNeeded' : 'Tank level state fill needed %s',\n        'production.tankLevel.state.floatSwitchState' : 'Tank level float switch %s',\n    }\n\n\nProbe HTML\n\nEach probe returns a block of text when executed.  This results in a nicely formatted list of data\nvalues that are obtained from a running mill.  This text is then wrapped in the '< pre >' tag to\npreserve the spacing.\n\nExample:\n    < pre >\n        Tank level state fill needed 42\n        Tank level float switch 1\n    < /pre >\n\n\nBuilding a new probe\n\nProbes are created on the server.  A new probe requires a name, a unit number, and a variable string\npattern to use in millcmd.  The existing file will not be overwritten to eliminate accidents.  The\nprobe will be created for the software version matching the unit.\n\nOnce a Probe Definition is create it can be manually edited to present the data value in a friendly\nway. \n\nExample:\n    sc probe-make 3006 pressure state.pressure\n    This creates a Probe Definition (probes/pressure-5.9.probe)\n    \n\nManaging software versions\n\nProbes are all tied to minor versions of software.  For example, 7.0.4 and 7.0.6 are both minor\nversion 7.0.\n\nWhen working with a probe the system will automatically match the probe version to the unit\nversion.  A lookup table is Support Center allow you to avoid doing this mapping manually.\n\nExample:\n    sc probe-exec 3006 pressure\n    Execute the probe 'probes/pressure-5.9.probe' on unit 3006\n", "user": 3, "title": "Mill Probe"}}, {"pk": 725, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/TemplateTasks", "time": "2014-06-15T20:38:24.502", "text": "* %s  *                 -*-muse-*-\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\n**Communicate** - share\n\n\n**Learn** - problem\n\n\n**Plan** - solution\n\n\n**Test** - verify\n\n\n**Fix** - defects\n\n\n**Extend** - features \n\n\n**Improve** - structure\n\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "%s"}}, {"pk": 726, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/MindTheGap", "time": "2014-06-15T20:38:24.665", "text": "* Mind The Gap *                 -*-muse-*-\n\nHow to Survive the Job Search Journey\nby Mark Seaman\n\nYour old job has ended but the new one has not yet started.  In fact, there is no job in sight.\nWhat do you do?  How can you process the journey of job search and live to tell the tale? Learn the\ntips that will let you have fewer sleepless nights and more peace each day.\n\nI recently found myself in the pool of job seekers.  It felt a little like those grade-B horror\nmovies where the zombies stagger around looking for some unidentifiable objective.  But in this case\nwe are looking for meaningful work.  Everything in our life seems hinged on this one goal.\n\nHere are some observations about things that I have learned during my job search.  Hopefully these\nideas will benefit you on your journey.\n\nMastering the job search puzzle really requires solving four separate puzzles.  Each of these areas\nmust be resolved for us to feel that we are making progress and positioning ourselves for success.\n\n * Purpose - we must discover the reason to go to work\n * Path - we must go on an emotional journey and grow personally\n * Process - we must learn the techniques for how to land a job\n * People - we must share the journey with those we trust\n\nTake a few minutes and write out your thoughts about how you are dealing with each of these areas.\nDoes any area stand out as needing more attention?  If so, focus on this area over the next day.\nIdentify ways that you might make changes to improve how you feel about it.\n\n\n* Find Your Purpose\n\nA sense of purpose can be a tricky thing.  But it is absolutely essential to the success of your job\nsearch.  If you aim at nothing you are sure to hit it.\n\nStart by discovering your superpowers. These include your hidden talents or special abilities.  Each\nperson has a unique personality.  There are no clones.  Your personality gives you a unique\npotential that no one else has.  It also disqualifies you from certain things that may come\nnaturally to others.  Respect your uniqueness and identify the traits that make you special.\n\nEach of us have situations where we know that we will thrive and others where we will die. Over the\nnext week, keep a list of each time you have been thrilled or drained.  Try to capture at least\nfive snapshots each day.  Analyze these to find the common threads.  Now imagine constructing a job\nenvironment where you experience all the thrills and avoid all the drains.  What does this teach you\nabout your job search?\n\nYour life has been a unique experience.  No one else has had your same a assets or liabilities.\nMake a list of these things in order to identify how to leverage them to get your perfect job.  Your\nactions to get the job should be customized to your special personality.  Leverage what you have in\norder to get the greatest gain.\n\nAn employer, client, or customer is only asking one question.   \"Do you bring more value than you\ncost?\"  Find creative ways to answer this question in their minds.  If you do, then you may not even\nhave to interview.  A demonstration of the value that you bring is much more important than what\nyour resume says.  Attempt to win the job before the race even starts.\n\nAttend events where you know your prospective employers hang out.  Show them that you can be the one\nto solve their problems.  This will make you the one indispensible choice for the position that you\nwant. Create your own dream job.\n\n\n* Find Your Path\n\nChange affect all of us in profound ways.  Use the stress of a job search to grow personally.\nUnderstanding the stages that the transition will bring will help to minimize the discomfort that we\nfeel. Pain is inevitable but growth is optional. By recognizing the stages of change we can know\nwhen we need courage to act or acceptance for things that are outside of our control.\n\nEnding is the first stage in the emotional journey of job search.  We must identify the loss of\nwhatever the old job offered us.  We need to be able to understand the loss to celebrate the good\nthings that we enjoyed.  Then we can truly accept the reality and mourn the loss with friends.\n\nThe gap between the ending and the beginning is a time of turmoil.  This period is a tunnel of chaos\nwhere anything can happen.  We have times when all hope is gone.  Each time there is a glimmer we\nput all of our hope on that one thing.  Then when it collapses we feel crushed.  This is a time to\nfocus on the important task of growing emotionally so that our confidence is based on something more\nthan the last conversation that we had.  Involve others close to you.  Draw encouragement from them.\n\nThe new beginning starts when we choose to get off the emotional roller-coaster.  This may be long\nbefore we actually get a job.  It starts when we feel a solid foundation.  At that point we know\nthat the external situation will be faced with restored confidence.\n\nEventually you will receive the fullfillment of your goals by getting the new job.  But the critical\nbattle is fought internally with our own fears.  This is a critical time when we need others to draw\nclose and surround us with their love.  We are always better together.  Don't face these challenges alone.\n\n\n* Find Your Process\n\nThe standard process for getting a job is completely broken for most people.  You may want to try to\ncreate your own process, at least as a part of your overall job search strategy.  Consider the\nfollowing instructions for ninja job search.\n\nCreate a list of 40 companies you want to consider. Spent 40 minutes, building four different\nlists. List companies you have already been thinking about (in 10 minutes).  Use indeed.com to\nsearch for opennings in your field (in 10 minutes).  Don't visit the details, just locate the\nopenings. List people you know where you would like their job. Search for companies in the news\nusing Google.  Spend 10 minutes on each list and have your top-40 in forty minutes.\n\nTurn your list of 40 companies into a table.  Columns include: Company, Contact(y/n), Postings(y/n),\nExcited.  Use indeed.com to find out if the company is hiring people like you.  You ninja strategy\nis to skip the application process in favor of getting to know an insider. You will research each\ncompany enough to learn if it is a good fit for you.\n\nYour contact inside the company is your most important source of information about the company.\nThey are also your most critical ally. Locate an advocate that will help you understand the hiring\nprocess and ask for an informational interview.\n\nUse what you learn to reprioritize your list of companies.  Make sure to follow up on all of the\nleads generated through the process and to thank everyone who will spend time with you.  Rearrange\nyour schedule to put you in contact with as many people as possible and look for opportunities to\nconnect with others.\n\nHow excited you feel about a particular company is the most important indicator of the motivation\nthat you have to pursue them. Start with the company that you are most excited about, and work your\nway down.  You have a deep bench but you will probably generate a job in the first 10-15 companies\nthat you work on.\n\nSend email to people that you have not met in order to get an informational interview.  Seek out\nanother contact if the first does not respond in three days. Repeat this overall process until you\nget hired.  For more details on the process read, \"2-hour Job Search\".  Easy read and great ideas\nfor all of the steps.\n\n\n* Find Your People\n\nA job search is an excellent time to deepen connections with others.  You may be more open than at\nany other time to both give and receive from others.   If you are a skilled professional you may\nstill be a novice job seeker.   This may be a newly found area of incompetence.  Others can help you\nwith advice and encouragement that you need.\n\nConsider finding a mentor that can speak to you about the things that you need to hear. Also find\nways that you can mentor others with insights that you have.  Both of these relationships are built\non trust and you will need that connection during this time.  It is also great to develop your\nrelationships with peers that you can get an objective view from.  Join a support group to work\nthrough possibilities for companies together.\n\nBeef up you professional network using modern tools like Linked In, and Meetup.com.  Become active\nin your professional organizations as well as job search groups.  This is no time to sit at home.\nIt is a time to be around people as much as possible.\n\nVolunteer your time by looking for opportunities to serve that also have a strategic benefit for\nyou. Use the time to learn a new skill or refresh old ones. Look for a creative break-through while\nyou have a community presence.  Always keep an attitude of service to others.\n\nThis is time to create a deeper connection with those around you. Trust is built by people taking\nrisks and having those rewarded.  Be willing to take for risks with your support network.  Share\ndeeper things and be willing to be vulnerable.  Your trust will almost certainly be reciprocated.\n\nPass on what you know and learn what others know.  We are always better together.\n\n\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Mind The Gap"}}, {"pk": 727, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/SpiritualIssues", "time": "2014-06-15T20:38:24.849", "text": "* Spiritual Issues *                 -*-muse-*-\n\nThere are some issues that need attention over a long period of time.

What makes Emacs so special?  There are a large number of\ntools that you must master to succeed.  The last thing any of us need is another tool with a\ncomplicated learning curve.\n\n\n**Return on investment**\nWhat percentage of your time is spent editing text?   If you are a software developer, like me, or\nan author, then you may expect to invest a lot of time typing words into a computer.  I average about\n9 hours on the computer each day.  About 75% of this time is editing text, the rest is mostly\nreading on the internet or a book on my tablet.\n\nI expect to work for another 15 years, and expect to log about 60 hours a week doing some kind of\ncomputer interaction.  This totals to about 3000 hours a year, with 75% of the time editing text.\nRealistically, I expect to spend over 33,000 hours writing.\n\nI believe that my productivity at editing has doubled in the last year from switching to Emacs.\nThis will certainly save me thousands of hours over the rest of my carreer.  This is the single\nlargest gain that you can make related to computer usage.\n\n\n**Choose the big lever**\nEmacs is very complicated to use.  It has a nearly vertical learning curve. It is frustrating at first\nto learn enough to do basic tasks without thinking seriously.  But it is also extremely powerful.\nThere is both a big cost and big reward for switch to Emacs.\n\nEmacs is readily available on any operating system that you will ever care about.  That is what\nprotects any investment that you make to learn it.   Learning to become a master at Emacs will\nrequire you about 30 hours.  After making this level of investment you will be significantly more\nproductive that you currently are.\n\nAfter you have made the initial investment you will have unexpected gains in many daily routines.\nEntire tasks that used to take a significant amount of time will simply evaporate.  You will find\nyourself with a lot of extra time to thing through bigger problems. All types of repeated work will\nbecome largely automatic with the features provided by Emacs.\n\n\n**Learning strategy**\nWhen I learned Emacs, I just jumped into the deep end of the pool.  I read a book, \"Pragmatic\nThinking and Learning\", by Andy Hunt.  In the book he mentioned the importance of learning how to\nget good at editing text and challenged me to learn Emacs.\n\nI decided to go for it!  I installed it and within a few minutes was completely overwhelmed.  There\nis just too much to learn, and I needed to still get my job done.  I took a weekend and figured out\nthe basics. Then continued to push forward.  Eventually I crested the hill and got where I needed to\nbe.\n\nThe resulting experience is this book.  By following the path that is laid out here, you can arrive\nat the same place with a lot less effort.  This book will give you a map for where you are going\nbefore you embark.\n\n\n**Pace yourself**\nEveryone has their own pace.  Find one that is right for you.  Consider investing an hour each day\nover the next month to work through this book.  This will get you into the \"Thriving Zone\" within a\nmonth. \n\nThere are two transformations taking place simulataneously.  You are learning new concepts and ideas\nabout how to use a new tool to speed up your work.  This is fairly straight forward.  \n\nThe second part is not nearly as easy to master.  You are retraining your automatic responses.  This\nfeels a lot like when you first learned to drive a car.  Your mind knows what you want to do but\nyour fingers will not follow along.\n\nAllow yourself time to let your fingers automatically find the right keys.   Analyse the way that\nyou do things and make small adjustment until the editor does exactly what you think it should do.\n\nIf you believe that typing \"Control-L\" should sort the lines in your buffer then that is the right\nanswer for you.  When this process is complete you will have a super-personal editor that no one\nelse in the world has.\n\n\n**More than typing**\nEditing text files is important.  You will see how to efficiently create and manipulate text\ndocuments.  After all, Emacs is a text editor at its core.  But there are a lot of other interesting\ntopics that are worth exploring.\n\nMost of the things written to help people learn about Emacs focus on the features and aspect of the\nprogram.  We are going to take a different approach.  Instead of learning about all of the things\nthat you can do, we will start with the needs that you have. \n\nEach day will focus on some key aspect that might need.  It will introduce the \"Big Idea\" and give\nyou some pointer.  It will also point you in the direction of getting more help and other resources\nyou might consider.\n\n\n**Two levels of learning**\nEach topic will have a key concept to understand.  You will get an idea of why this topic is\nimportant to you and some overall pointers.  For some people this may be the only learning that you\nneed.  You may consider going through every topic and picking off only the big ideas.\n\nFor others you will want to go deeper.  There should be enough meat for you to digest and mull\nover.  There are also excerises that you can try and other resources to follow.\n\nI recommend reading through the high level ideas of each topic, in order to decide if you want to\ninvest the energy to learn Emacs.

It is implemented as a shell\nscript.\n\n    $ echo 'clear;ls $*' > bin/l    # Create the script\n    $ chmod +x bin/l                # Make exe\n    $ l bin                         # Test it\n\nThe 'u' command will be an alias so that the changed directory applies to the currently executing\nshell.\n\n    $ echo \"alias u='cd ..;l'\" >> .bashrc   # Append alias to profile\n    $ . .bashrc                             # Make it active\n    $ cd bin; u                             # Test it\n\nThe 'd' command must take an argument so it must be a shell function.\n\n    $ echo 'function d { pushd $1;l }' >> .bashrc  # Append function to profile\n    $ . .bashrc                             # Make it active\n    $ d bin                                 # Test it\n\nFinally the 'b' command can be an alias.\n\n    $ echo \"alias b='popd;l'\" >> .bashrc    # Append alias to profile\n    $ . .bashrc                             # Make it active\n    $ d bin; b                              # Test it\n\nMess with this until you feel totally comfortable with the ideas here.\n\n\nSee also DaysOfLinux\n", "user": 3, "title": "Directory Navigation"}}, {"pk": 747, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/GooglePlus", "time": "2014-06-15T20:38:28.819", "text": "* Google Plus *                 -*-muse-*-\n\nGoogle+ is an amazing tool that can enable a whole new level of\nconnection with the people in your life.  Consider using it for\nbuilding a modern communication strategy.  It brings social media to\neveryone without the junkie frivolity of FaceBook or the austere\nrestrictions of LinkedIn.\n\nUnlike FaceBook, you can control which messages go to which circles of\npeople that you know.  This lets you conduct multiple separated,\nthreaded discussions at the same time.  You can plan an event with\npeople in your school while keeping your family updated without boring\nanyone with unrelated info.\n\nI've been using LinkedIn since it first debuted in 2006.  Almost no\none communicates there.  It seems to be mostly a place to post your\nresume so that people can see what you are doing.  \n\nThe primary limitation of both LinkedIn and FaceBook is that you can\nnot segment the groups of people to interact with them.  In essence,\nevery conversation that you have is a wildly public conversation.\nMany people are overwhelmed by a lot of discussions that they have no\ninterest in.\n\nEnter Google+.  Imagine going through your contacts and dividing them\ninto groups based on which conversation topics they are interested\nin.  Then create a social networking system around that.\n\nIt sounds like a lot of work, but Google+ has made it very easy.  This\nis a system that is optimized for slapping together a group anytime\nyou want.\n\nIn addition, there are excellent mobile phone applications, and the web\nbrowser works fine as well.  Put all of this together and you have a\nwonderful new way to communicate.\n\nI'm totally sold!\n\n\nSee also GoogleCircle, GooglePlusProject\n", "user": 3, "title": "Google Plus"}}, {"pk": 748, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/MindTouch", "time": "2014-06-15T20:38:29.014", "text": "* Mind Touch *                 -*-muse-*-\n\n*Learn about the Mind Touch wiki platform*\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**Learn**\nhttp://mindtouch.com\nhttp://developer.mindtouch.com\n[[http://developer.mindtouch.com/en/docs/mindtouch_setup/010Installation/Installing_on_VirtualBox/Importing_MindTouch_VM_into_VirtualBox#Download_the_VMware_image][Virtual Box installation]]\nhttps://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads\nhttp://www.turnkeylinux.org/core\nhttp://www.turnkeylinux.org/deki\n\n**Plan**\n - install virtual box on chute\ndownload Mind Touch VM (OVF version)\nevaluate other appliances\n\n**Build**\ndebug Mind Touch appliance\n\n**Teach**\nwrite up notes\ncapture key tips and tricks\n\nSee also VirtualBox, CloudComputing\n\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Mind Touch"}}, {"pk": 749, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/SpiritualJournal", "time": "2014-06-15T20:38:29.212", "text": "* Spiritual Journal *                 -*-muse-*-\n\n*Ideas about spiritual things*\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**Journal Purpose**\n\nThis journal is intended to encourage my spiritual development by increasing the amount of time I\nspend thinking about issues of spiritual growth. What gets fed grows, so it is time to feed the\nspirit. I don't feel that much time has been given to the things of the spirit over the last couple\nof years. It is time for a change.\n\nThis journal follows a few simple rules, AbsoluteHonesty is required to produce anything of\nvalue. The journal is AddressedToGod and could be used as a prayer. I intend to update this journal\nas part of a program for improving my OngoingHabits.\n\nI am desiring to pursue You more diligently and consistently on a daily basis. Keeping a spiritual\njournal is a key part of my life with You. It causes me to have an increased awareness and focus on\nwhat You are doing within me and the issues that are driving my thoughts.\n\nI have shared this commitment to journaling with Stacie, Dick Spitler, and Bruce Hoppe. This will\nprovide some accountability for me for additional motivation.\n\nMy plan is to write something every day in this journal. It doesn't have to be a lot, but it must be\nsomething. For the next 40 days I will record my progress each day and restart if I miss a day. At\nthen end of that time I will celebrate my new habit of journaling.\n\n\n**Daily Needs**\n\nEach day depends on Your provision and blessing. It is so hard to comprehend or remember that\ntruth. In my daily striving it is so easy to think that everything depends on me. I ask You to give\nme the things that I need for today. Give me wisdom to know how this day should be spent.\n\nBeing a two-cracker guy I want to store up manna for the future, instead of trusting You to provide\nfor tomorrow as well as You do today. Help me to focus my attentions on the things that are needed\ntoday rather than borrow trouble from tomorrow.\n\nIt is so wonderful to see how GodProvides. ThankYou for all of Your blessings. But I want our\nrelationship to move BeyondBlessings.  \n\n\n**In The Present**\n\nHelp me to meet with You in the present. That is the best place where I can experience Your\npresence. I can recieve Your mercy, Your peace, Your guidance, Your correction, and Your power\nworking in me.\n\nEach moment I can reach out and touch You. I can call out to You. I can surrender my will to You,\nbut only in the present. Recalling a time when we were close is meaningless if my heart is rebelling\nnow. Anticipating a time when I will lay it all down is false if right now I refuse to yield.\n\nMy will operates in the now. I choose to yield or wrest control only now. The past and the future\ndon't really matter when it comes to meeting with You. Help me to see my life as a series of\nindividual moments that might be spent with You, rather than wasted on self indulgence.\n\nNow is the time when I can depend on You for my DailyNeeds. Now is the time when I can ThankYou for\nwhat You have done.\n\n\n**By Your Grace**\n\nI am amazed how hard it is for me to remain aware that it is all about You. I so easily revert to\nbelieving that somehow I am responsible for carrying this relationship forward. Yet when I look deep\nin my heart it is clear that there is nothing good that You did not put there.\n\nThank You for wooing me to You. Thank You for choosing me to follow You. Thank You for transforming\nmy heart. Thank You for the further transformation that is yet to take place. Thank You for the\nultimate destination of eternity with You.\n\nWithout Your power working in my life there is still no hope for me. It is not as if You have fixed\nme and now I can take it from here. I am more accurately in a constant state of spiritual brokenness\nand You are all that stands between me and the abyss.\n\n\n**Daily Habits**\n\nRick Warren described nine habits to make us more loving\n\nPhysical Habits\n    Rest\n    Exercise\n    Diet\n\nEmotional Habits\n    Recreation\n    Laughter\n    Helping others\n\nSpiritual Habits\n    Solitude\n    Service\n    Denying yourself\n\n\n**Quiet Time Activities**\n\nThere are a number of essential activities that replensih the spirit. These enhance life and must be done regularly.\n\n    Worship\n    Thanksgiving\n    Acknowledge my fears\n    Forgive others\n    Reflect on what is going well\n    Explore changes\n    Read scripture\n    Prayer journal\n    Read inspirational book\n    Read training book\n    Read blogs\n    Imagine three years from now\n    Plan a good deed\n    Weekly review and planning\n    Analyze a big problem\n    Review the last 90 days\n    Reflect on recent learning\n    Make a list of books to read\n    Identify great sources of joy\n    Write my life story\n    Examine last year\n    Write in journal\n\n\n**My Dream Job** - These are based on my Work Values\n\nFollowing are my characteristics for a dream job.\n\n    I use my strengths every day\n    My clients appreciate my expertise\n    I earn a high wage per hour worked\n    90% of the total work time is billable\n    There is a feeling of teamwork and respect\n    I am making an important contribution each day\n    I am paid to learn new things\n    The work location is flexible allowing me to work part of the time at home\n    I can get work when I need it\n    Clients trust my judgment\n    I have flexibility to take time off\n    Selling is not the main focus of the job\n    I am able to establish ongoing relationships with clients\n    I trust my clients\n    I can see a way to be successful\n    Creativity is required to solve new problems\n    I learn and share best practices\n    I organize tasks within a project\n    The client desires agility\n    Minimal time is spent on people issues\n    Efficiency and effectiveness are important\n    My expertise is unique\n\n\n**Pray For Work**\n\nYour word tells us DontWorry and yet I often worry when I should pray instead. You know the\nimportance of work in my life. Even though I am currently employed there is a degree of uncertainty\nassociated with it.\n\nToday I found myself concerned that I would not be able to keep steady work coming. One prospect\nthat was a significant hope appears less so now. An existing client is struggling to pay me for\nprevious work. It is easy to fixate on the circumstance rather than the provider.\n\nLord, You have always given us so much more than we have ever needed. Thank You for Your constant\ncare for us. I know that You will be there for us no matter what situations we face. Thanks for Your\npeace.\n\n\n**Ideal Work**\n\nOptimize the following attributes\n\n    Low stress - 1 problem sleeping / month\n    Invested time - 50 hours / week\n    Total income - $/hour invested\n    Value produced - Billable rate $70\n\n\n**Embracing Brokenness**\n\nI try so hard to be self sufficient and in complete control. But true dependence on You requires\nthat I get to the end of my resources. As long as I can create the life that I want without You then\nI am not really trusting You.\n\nWhen I finally have arrived at the end of my own abilities then You are there to meet me. You are\nmore interested in relationship than my comfort. Brokenness is the place where I completely\nsurrender to You.\n\nBrokenness is where I discover Your plan and purpose for me. Because I have given up on my dreams\nYou are able to give me new ones. Not only is the goal different, but the means are also changed. I\ntrade self-sufficiency for Your power.\n\nBrokenness is the state where I realize that You are God and I am not. It is when I become teachable\nand moldable. Until I have been broken I can not serve Your purpose.\n\nBrokenness replaces self-delusion with truth. It makes me acknowledge what has always been true -\nthat You are in control.\n\nAt the Iron Men's breakfast my answer came. Jerry White spoke about facing loss. He said that every\nman will face 5 types of loss. Men will lose identity, influence, position, motivation, and\nsecurity.\n\nHe described my situation. We all experience this loss ,but we are always surprised by it.\n\nI recognized that You had put me in this situation for His purpose. It was no accident. You were\ndoing something inside of me that would make the discomfort worth it.\n\nThat changed my perception of the whole situation. It was no longer about the reasons for the\nissues. I needed to understand what You were desiring to do within me.\n\nI try everything in our power to fix the situation. Sometimes it is the very situation that You are\nusing to fix me.\n\nBrokenness is an emotional state where we embrace truth.\nSelf sufficiency keeps us from discovering the truth.\nIn brokenness we find truth.\n\nIn our need we find a provider.\nIn our illness we find a healer.\nIn our despair we find a savior.\n\nWe want the provider, healer, and savior. We just don't want to be in a state where we need it.\n\n\n**Fear Itself**\n\nIf left to our own nature we will be consumed by fear. There are many bad things that could happen\nto us. It is tempting to engage in fantasies about how bleak the future could be.\n\nHope is creating a positive fantasy of the future. Some people are by nature more hopeful. The real\nbasis of all our hope is You, God. If You control the shape of our lives and direct its course then\nwe can trust You completely with the future.\n\nHelp me to have this sense of security and peace about the future. I am tired of living in\nfear. Show me how I can live a life of complete faith in You.\n\n\n**So Much Pain**\n\nThis world is filled with pain. There are so many things that are out of control due to the fallen\nnature of this world. Every person faces a series of struggles to make something good out of our\nlives. It often seems that the human drama is this struggle itself. How do we survive and even\nthrive in world broken by sin?\n\nTeach me how to depend on You for everything. Show me how to serve others and give them hope.\n\n\n**Beyond Blessings**\n\nIt is true that You give us everything that we need. But I don't want that to be the\nsole basis of our relationship together. I know that You don't want that either. Forgive me for\nseeking Your blessings and not Your intimacy.\n\nI want to be Your friend and Your son, not just legally, but in practical reality. I want my daily\nreality, and choices to be determined by You. I desire to live my life in Your presence as an act of\nworship.\n\n**Connecting With People**\n\nWhen I think about communicating with people, I am consumed with my role in the relationship. This\ntakes two forms: what can I get from them, and what should I communicate. This is all wrong and\ntwisted. It means that every relationship is about me.\n\nLord, help me to see as valuable and interesting in their own right, rather than means to achieve my\nself-centered goals. Give me an attitude of service toward others. Show me ways that I can serve\nwithout expecting repayment of any kind.\n\nI am so ashamed of my selfishness. Help me to change. Give me Your attitude for people.\n\n\n**My Fears**\n\nThese are my greatest fears:\n\n    rejection\n    exposure\n    ridicule\n    insignificance\n    lack of resources\n    injury\n    sickness\n    pain\n    death\n    loss of sexuality\n    loss of faith\n    loss of identity\n    loss of security\n    loss of control\n    being alone\n    loss of a loved one\n    hopelessness\n    loss of position\n    loss of influence\n    lost motivation\n\nFear is such a powerful influence in life. Lord help me to allow You into my fears. Give me the\nstrength to surrender even the darkest fears to You.\n\n\n**My Plan Vs Gods**\n\nI love to create plans. This is my way of establishing control. These plans are often in conflict\nwith Your plan and purpose for me.\n\nYou see the beginning from the end. While my view is incredibly limited, Your's is not. You really\ndo know what is best.\n\nOver the past year I have learned more about how dependent I am on You. Without You I can't do\nanything. Help me, Lord, to embrace Your presence daily.\n\nThe Lord directs our steps, so why try to understand everything along the way?\n\n\nSee also  AddressedToGod,  AbsoluteHonesty, OngoingHabits, LifeCycle\n\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Spiritual Journal"}}, {"pk": 750, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/TricksForRapidDevelopment", "time": "2014-06-15T20:38:29.429", "text": "* Tricks For Rapid Development *                 -*-muse-*-\n\n**Small steps**\nmake it simpler\nnever lose control or stability  (move slow to move fast)\nfix it now; do not ignore problems\nmake it better with every step\ndelay work until it is needed\n\n**test first**\nrerun automatic tests for free\neach test should be one line \nevery line of code should have a test\nschedule tests to run each week,day,hour\nsystem tests are scripts that use your system\nunit test are for isolated functions\n\n**automation**\ncreate your own language for working your system\nscripts are named for the desired result\nbuild your own future\nfind a bigger lever\n\n**predictable results**\nrun from source every time\neverything should be kept in version control\nautomate all deployment tasks\ndefine the full context required to run your system\n\n\n See also  RapidDevelopment, DevelopmentRules\n\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Tricks For Rapid Development"}}, {"pk": 751, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/TheCity", "time": "2014-06-15T20:38:29.658", "text": "* The City *                 -*-muse-*-\n\n**Seaman's Connecting Small Group**\nBeth Ball <bethball78@msn.com>,\nGene & Debbie Edmunds <bluegrass927@q.com>,\nJoe & Robin Martinez <Maxlog31@yahoo.com>,\nKevin and Terri Burke <Burke2K@yahoo.com>,\nMark & Amy Schild <mandaschild@q.com>,\nNate & Keri Ladd <nathanlwladd@gmail.com>,\nPat and Claudine Warren <cawarr97002@comcast.net>,\nPaula Petroff  <pcpetroff@hotmail.com>,\nMark Seaman <mark@seamanfamily.org>,\nMark & Kimberly Austin <MrMark@Comcast.net>,\n\nWe are setting up a group within the City to communicate about our\nsmall group.

We operate based on principles and\npractices that allow us to produce more value than any competitor.  We build life-long partnerships\nwith others.  We execute projects using the best practices available.\n\nShrinking World Solutions is built on several core ideas.  From these a set of operating practices\ngovern the daily activities of the company.\n\n\n** Principles of Business **\n\nWhat are the unchanging principles that make your business tick?\n\n1. **Agile** - we only do what must be done\n \nThere are an infinite number of things that could be done to grow the company.  But many of these\ngood things, are not essential.  We are committed to delay actions until they are really\nneeded. This allows us to concentrate on the essential tasks that produce immediate value.\n\n2. **Trust** - we aim for life-long partnerships\n\nAll relationships are built on trust.  We seek to conduct ourselves in such a way to build trust\nwith our partners (clients, employees, colleagues).  These relationships are more vital to the\nlong-term health of the business than short-term profits.\n\n3. **Value** - we look for 10 times ROI\n\nThere are many problems that could be worked on.  We select the problems that produce the largest\nbenefit for the effort expended.  Most businesses have pressing problems that cost the business a\ngreat deal of money.  We hope to achieve results that are ten times the cost of the solution.\n\n4. **Solutions** - we solve pressing problems quickly and elegantly\n\nWe believe that simplicity is the key to great solutions.  Often a simple solution that is put in\nplace immediately is far superior to a more complete solution that takes a long time to implement.\n\n5. **Best Practices** - we do what works\n\nWe have spent decades learning and sharing best practices in software development techniques.  When\nyou hire us you benefit from the learning and experimentation.   This allows us to quickly implement\nlasting improvements to your technology and processes.\n\n6. **Open** - we freely share everything we can\n\nWe believe that ideas are best when shared.  We invite you to join with us in mutual collaborations\nthat can be share with others.  We believe that businesses win by sharing because they can move\nfaster than their competitors.  The days of protectionism are over.  We freely share any \ngeneral-purpose knowledge and techniques with our clients.\n\n\nSee also [[Business]], BusinessPractices\n", "user": 3, "title": "Business Policies"}}, {"pk": 769, "model":

Here are a few patterns that can help \n         \n              you in thinking better. \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              <b>List limit of 9 items</b> \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              Psychological studies have shown that people can only retain up to nine \n         \n              items in short-term memory.  This means that any list where you expect a selection ony works up to \n         \n              nine items.  Longer lists should be broken into multiple selection lists.  A reasonable list should \n         \n              have five or more items to be useful.  Nesting can be used to handle more complicated scenarios. \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              <b>Minimize mindshare</b> \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              Some things we can control and other things we cannot.  Try to make your \n         \n              circle of influence match your circle of concern.  Decrease the amount of mental energy that you \n         \n              invest in areas where you have little influence.  Save your energy for the things that you can \n         \n              change. \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              <b>Eliminate multitasking</b> \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              Your worst enemy is multiple tasks interrupting each other. Focus on one \n         \n              activity as much as possible until it is completed.  Then go on to the next with equal focus.  It \n         \n              is very easy for us to spend as much as 50% of our overall time just switching between multiple \n         \n              tasks.  This has become especially bad in our modern world.  Most people underestimate the cost of \n         \n              multitasking. \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              <b>Scheduled thinking</b> \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              Consider having a block of time scheduled to think through problems. \n         \n              Imagine knowing that you could just file that issue away for 3:00 Thursday.  I recommend that you \n         \n              perform this think time in a location where you cannot be interrupted.  Start with one hour per \n         \n              week.  You are likely to find that you need more time, and that it is easily justified by the \n         \n              return that you get. \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              <b>Think before you leap</b> \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              When confronted with a big decision consider taking both paths.  Imagine \n         \n              trying to live with each of the alternatives.  Which one seems to carry the least risk?  Which is \n         \n              better in the short term or in the long term?  What problem might surface?  What does your \n         \n              intuition tell you? \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              <b>Brainstorm/organize</b> \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              A great way to work out problems is to brainstorm.  This typically involves \n         \n              making a list of various ideas or impression.  During a brainstorm try to postpone judgment.  Once \n         \n              you have captured a bunch of ideas you can work on grouping things together.  This is the time to \n         \n              apply some judgment and pruning. \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              <b>Four by four analysis</b> \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              In order to think through, a topic try this technique. Break your main \n         \n              topic into four roughly equal topics.  Then decompose each of them into four more topics.  I found \n         \n              that this technique is remarkably useful to help me see the interesting aspects of almost any \n         \n              subject. It gives you twenty one statements that have both breadth and depth that can be explored later. \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              <b>Work on only one thing</b> \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              Select a single task that will be the most satisfying to have done. \n         \n              Postpone distractions until this task is complete. By selecting this task you are saying that this \n         \n              is the most important thing that you could do right now.  If you feel that a legitimate \n         \n              interruption is likely then limit the scope of your task to complete it sooner. Then you can focus \n         \n              on another task when needed. \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              <b>Use tools that preserve context</b> \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              Don't have multiple windows up on your computer (each vying for \n         \n              your attention). When you run an application, make the window take the full screen. Finish one \n         \n              thought before going on the next.  Turn off email notification, and check it between tasks.  If you \n         \n              don't control your tools they will control you.  Know what you must do in your job to succeed and \n         \n              create the environment that lets you focus.  If your job calls for 10 second response time on IM, \n         \n              then play along.  If it is a constant distraction, turn it off. \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              <b>Try new things</b> \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              Break \n         \n              your routine occassionally.  Keep a list of random things to do for fun. \n         \n              At least once a week, pick a fun thing and do it.  Life is too serious for most of us. Look up an \n         \n              old friend.  Do a random act of kindness.  Play a practical joke.  Tell someone that you love them. \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              <b>Random item from the past</b> \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              Imagine having a list of things to think about someday.  Now image \n         \n              doing a random selection from that list.  This would give you a miscellaneous topic to ponder for a \n         \n              few minutes.  I use this technique for a number of different lists.  I frequently get emails of \n         \n              ticklers to remind me of things that I originally thought about earlier.  The key idea here is to \n         \n              have a list of topics and a random selection.  You could do the same thing by shuffling 3 x 5 cards \n         \n              with ideas. \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              <b>Say in fewer words</b> \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              I \n         \n              like to make complex subjects simple.  One way to do this is to describe \n         \n              something and then try to capture the same ideas with half of the words.  Is it possible to get the \n         \n              same idea in 5 words?  Try to think in sound bites. \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              <b>List of current problems</b> \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              Consider keeping a list of problems that need think-time.

Secure\nShell technology (SSH) permits you to control a remote computer without having actual physical\naccess to the machine. SSHs network traffic is encrypted, and assuming you configure SSH correctly,\nquite secure.  Ubuntu Linux has always had strong support for SSH, and Karmic Koala 9.10 is no\ndifferent. You can use an SSH implementation called OpenSSH Server to remotely, securely access your\nmachine.\n\nHeres how to install and perform a basic security configuration of OpenSSH Server on Ubuntu 9.10\nKarmic Koala.\n\nFirst, youll need to install OpenSSH Server. To do so, open up a Terminal window and type the\nfollowing command:\n\nsudo apt-get install openssh-server\n\napt-get will then download and install OpenSSH Server. Depending upon the speed of your computer and\nInternet connection, the installation may take several minutes.\n\nOnce the installation has finished, return to the Terminal. Well need to make a few changes to your\n/etc/ssh/sshd_config file in order to increase SSHs security. First, however, well want to make a\nbackup copy of your sshd_config file in case anything goes wrong. Type this command into the\nTerminal:\n\nsudo cp /etc/ssh/sshd_config ~\n\nThis will make a backup copy of the sshd_config file in your home directory.\n\nNext, well need to edit the sshd_config file itself:\n\nsudo gedit /etc/ssh/sshd_config\n\n(Obviously you can use vi or emacs or the editor of your choice instead, though newer Linux users\ntend to find gedits GUI easier to use.)\n\nOnce youre editing the file, youll want to add the following two directives to the end of the file:\n\nPermitRootLogin no\n\nAllowUsers USERNAME\n\nPermitRootLogin no will block root from logging in via SSH. Its best to never enable root SSH\naccess, since if an attacker happens to figure out the root password, he or she will have total\nremote control over your system.\n\nAllowUsers adds an additional layer of protection by only allowing specific users to connect via\nSSH. For instance, if you wanted only users test1 and test2 to have SSH access, you would set\nAllowUsers as AllowUsers test1 test2.\n\nYou may also want to consider changing the Ports directive. By default SSH runs over TCP/IP port 22,\nwhich means that any malware bot autoscanning port 22 can target it. Changing the Ports directive to\nsomething different will make SSH run over a different, blocking some of those automated cracking\nattempts.\n\nOnce you have finished changing your settings, save the sshd_config file, and restart the SSH daemon\nwith this command:\n\nsudo /etc/init.d/ssh restart\n\nYou should now be able to SSH into your Ubuntu machine from another system with an SSH client.\n\n\nSee also ComputerSetup\n", "user": 3, "title": "Open SSH"}}, {"pk": 807, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/JordanActions", "time": "2014-06-15T20:38:42.127", "text": "* Jordan Actions *                 -*-muse-*-\n\n**Acions**\nThoughts on Jordan Partnership\nDesign Aweber strategy\nRename city group\nJordan city posting\nMiddle-east situation\nActionCycle\n\n**Bristow & Jami**\ntrip followup\npersonal review\ncommunication\npartnership\n\n**Partnership Presentation**\nBetter Together\n    Unity is Central to the Gospel\n    Division Impedes Revival\n    It Starts with Us\n    Everyone Brings Something\nFocus on Youth\n    70% under 23\n    Younger People are More Open\n    Seeds of Revival\n    Ignite The Current Generation\nBuilding a Partnership\n    Start Small;

In fact there are three unique contexts that are\nimportant at each stage of development.   Understanding what is shared\nand what is unique will speed your development.\n\nThe three contexts that you should consider are:\n 1. **Customer benefit** - when and how will you make business use of the\n    new feature.\n 2. **Product** - how does this feature integrate with the rest of the\n    product features\n 3. **Function** - how does this feature work in total isolation\n\nEvery feature that you write should be developed through all three\ncontexts.  You will plan the three together but you will build and\ntest from the bottom up.\n\n**Functional Context**\nWhen you create a new feature in the software, start by creating the\nsmallest possible context for your development.  This should probably\nresult in creating a two line test that calls a function and tests for\nan expected result.  Actually this is a single line that should look\nsomething like, 'assert(test_is_ok())'.  \n\nThis requires you to completely isolate or encapsulate the\ndependencies of your system.  This act alone will give you a much\nsharper view of your system.  The key part of the functional context\nis to make testing your new code independent of as much of the rest of\nthe system as possible.\n\n**Product Context**\nThe product context is your opportunity to integrate the new feature\nwith all of the other parts of the system.  The functional context\ntests the inside view of the feature, while the product context tests\nthe outside view.\n\nGood testing at this level involves having real world data that you\nput through the entire system to verify the results.  Consider testing\nas a pipeline, 'read input > process > gather output > analyze for errors'.\n\n**Customer Context**\nThe customer context also brings in the issues of how this\nfunctionality gets deployed.  No feature works in isolation. Examine\nthe full customer experience and make sure that the feature integrates\nconsistently with all other aspects of the application.\n\nTesting at this context involves using the product like a real\ncustomer would and may actually involve real customers. Problems\nidentified at this context should be solved and verified at a lower\ncontext level.\n\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Development Contexts"}}, {"pk": 823, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/RunningFromGod", "time": "2014-06-15T20:38:45.878", "text": "* Running From God *                 -*-muse-*-\n\nThe story of Jonah describes what happens when we run from God.\n\nCertainties that we will experience:\n\n * We run to dangerous places\n * Things we unravel\n * We hurt those closest to us\n * God is in the unraveling\n * He will provide an escape\n\n\n See also PrayerPractices \n\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Running From God"}}, {"pk": 824, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/GrowthSeasons", "time": "2014-06-15T20:38:46.420", "text": "* Growth Seasons *                                       -*-muse-*-\n\nAging is inevitable but growth is not.\nThere are natural seasons and rhythms of growth.\nThis site is a toolto help you focus on personal growth by focusing on a different topic each month.\n\nWork -- What will I do?\n\n    1.

you to go from no previous knowledge of Django\nto building a web application using Django.  \n\nIn addition to getting an overview of Django, I'm going to dive into some detail on the\n50 Tricks that are essential to building an application.  Building a web\napplication, or any other program for that matter, is really a matter of understanding\nthe specific tricks that you need to do to get your technical work done and then\nassembling those tricks based on the needs of your application.  \n\nPresentationGoals\n\nBy the end of this book you will know how to create a running web application using the 50 Tricks.  The 50 Tricks are a catalogue of best practices that will provide you with one interesting way to solve a particular problem - rather than present all the possible ways that you might solve that particular problem.  \n\nWhatsDjango\n\nSo let's start by talking about Django.  Django is a framework that is very\nsimilar to ASP.net or Rails or JSP and it's based on a language in the same way that\nC-sharp is used to write ASP.net applications or Ruby is used to write Rail\napplications.  So Python is to Django like Ruby is to Rails.  Building a web\napplication requires both a great computer language and a framework that solves\na lot of the recurring problems for you.  When you select a programming language, you also need to select a framework. \n\nWhyDjango\n\nThere are many different frameworks written in Python. I selected Django after evaluating a number of other frameworks such as Pyramid, for example.  Django offers a great set of features and it's also interesting that Django was created by factoring real world applications.  A number of different applications were created and then the commonality, the common\nelements of those applications, were re-factored into a library that could be used on future applications.  \n\nSome frameworks are created by analyzing a problem in the abstract and then developing a framework, Django was developed by capturing real world applications in specific elements that were reusable within that. This avoids the Ivory Tower design problem and ensures that everything in the library is there for a reason. When you re-factor real applications; you end\nup with a minimalistic framework, rather than a conglomeration of everything that someone could think to include - everything is there because it has an immediate use in an actual\nsituation.  \n\nAnother thing that attracted me to Django is the docs are probably better than any other technical documentation I've read.  There are a number of different hosting options available.  I recommend the kind of hosting where you pay about 10 bucks a month and get a shared virtual server that can be set up in about an hour.  The result is, with the investment of about an hour's worth of time and 10 bucks a month, you can host your application. I set up new hosting for each new Django app I develop because the hosting is virtually free, compared to the development time.\n\nThe other thing that's really nice about Django is it's really great for automation.\nYou can expose all of the functionality of your running application, your running\nGUI.  You can expose that either as a web service or as a set of scripts that you\ncan use with command line operations to do the same thing.  I find that this is\nreally, really useful for doing automated testing and there's a lot of automated testing capabilities built into the framework itself.  \n\nLearnByDoing\n\nI believe in learning by doing.  The fastest way to learn something is to pick a project and pick a technology - dive in and figure out what problems you need to solve along the way rather than trying to learn a lot about the technology before you start working on a project.  This is a similar approach to the refactoring of applications into a framework, creating a INSERTlearning a technology like creating an application is the fastest way to go.  The project we'll use as an example for this book is a wiki.\n\n\nFiftyTricks\n\nLet's talk about 50 Tricks.  There are two types of knowledge: there is a broad base\nof engineering knowledge which involves things like how to define a software project,\nhow to design the actual writing of the code, the debugging and testing of that code.\nThat's a general body of knowledge that is very transportable from project to project\nand from technology to technology.  \n\nThe other type of knowledge that engineers have that is valuable is a specific\ntechnology that translates into a catalogue of how to solve specific\nproblems.  I'm calling these tricks because, once you know a specific trick, you can\napply that trick in about an hour.  But to learn a new trick, takes about a day's\nworth of experimentation and messing around.  And I'm hoping that this presentation\nwill short-circuit that activity for you so that you can see one successful way to do\neach trick and then, when you're working on your pile of project, you can basically\njust draw from my catalogue of tricks and then maybe in a couple of hours, have a\nworking knowledge of how to apply that trick, rather than a whole day.  \n\nThis idea of tricks is what explains the difference between people that are very\neffective at using a technology and people that are just learning that technology.  If\nyou switch technologies, you basically flush your bag of tricks and have to restock it\nwith that new technology.  So if you're a really good Ruby programmer and you are\ngoing to Python for the first time, for example, you will have to restock your tricks,\nrelearn the -- even though you may know a lot of the Ruby tricks for doing all of\nthese things that we're going to present, you will have to go back and relearn each of\nthe tricks for the technology that you're trying to do. \n\nSo if we compare two programmers, one that is very fluent in a technology and one that\nis not fluent and the average application requires about 50 tricks, this whole project\ncan be completed in about 50 hours.  If a person is at the same time they're\ndeveloping the application, they are learning the tricks, then that same project will\ntake that person about 50 days.  And so this accounts for the order of magnitude\ndifference in program productivity.  It's not how smart the people are, but how\nfamiliar they are with this specific technology and the tricks that are part of that\ntechnology.\n\nTrickGroups\n\nSo we're going to be looking at seven groups of tricks in our application development.\nThe first set of tricks that we're going to be looking at is how to set up a server.\nThe next set of tricks is about working with data inside your application.  And then\nwe're going to work with views and we're going to work with formatting, getting the\nstyle that you want.  Then we're going to be working with documents in the file system\nand in the database and then we are going to look at user authentication and\nauthorization.  And then we are going to kind of step back and take a look at some\nproject-related tricks, as well.  \n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\n**Server  (5 Tricks)**\n\nServerStart\n\nOkay, we're ready to start our first set of tricks.  So what we want to do is we want\nto set up a Django server that can serve our project needs.  So the first that we need\nto be able to do is we need to be able to run the server application.  So Django ships\nwith a lightweight server that can be used instead of Apache.  When you go to\nproduction, you're definitely going to want to deploy your application on an\nindustrial server, like Apache, but for development purposes, you can spin up with one\nline of code, you can spin up a server and you can test out all your things and be\nable to work with your application.  \n\nSo here what I've done is I've shown you how to get that server running.  There is a\nmanaged script and you just use the script inside of that, called Runserver and now\nall of a sudden, you have your application listening to whatever port you told it to\nlisten to and serving your pages.\n\nWhen you go to production, you're likely to want to deploy that on Apache.  There are\na number of other options that you can use as well, but I deploy most of my Django\napplications on Apache.  And so here's an example of restarting the server remotely\nfrom a development machine.  So all you really need to do is you need to SSH into a\nparticular machine name and then you need to find the restart script in Apache and\njust run it.  And so that one line of code will net you a remote server.  \n\nOkay, the next thing that we want to do now that we're running our server is we want\nto load a web page and check it out.  And so when we're running our development\nserver, it normally starts up on port 8000.  So if you just point Firefox to\nlocalhost:8000 that will load your pages.  That's the first trick, starting the\nserver.  \n\nCreateProject\n\nThe second trick that we want to do is we want to create a new project.  So we're\nready to start our thing, we're ready to start writing code.  There's a set of scripts\nthat are bundled under the Django admin script.  And so if you just type Django admin\nstart project Mystore then it will create a new project for you called Mystore.  And\nwhat you see here in that directory is a number of different files that Django will\ncreate for you, including the glue logic that runs in the web server that allows you\nto answer HTTP requests.  So all that infrastructure is created for you and all you\nneed to do is modify a few basic settings to add your application logic. \n\nHelloWorld\n\nAnd so the next that we do is we see the end of the directory and we run the server\nand then we load the web page.  So now you should have a running web application.  \n\nThe next that we want to do, our application, it runs, but it doesn't do anything and,\nat the very minimum, we want to answer and HTTP request.  And so this is just about\nthe simplest application that you can write.  So here what we do is there is a URLs\nfile that is automatically created for us.  And what we are going to do is we are\ngoing to hook in to that URLs file and give it regular expression that matches the\nHTTP request that is going to be made.  And then we're going to generate a HTTP\nresponse for that.  So we could do all of this in about three lines of code. \n\nInterviewer:\tSo is each one of these slides one trick?  So the one earlier where you\nhad three different blue headers or is that just one trick between the three of them?\n\nRespondent:\tThat's one trick, starting the server and then creating a project, one trick.\nOne trick saying hello world.  \n\n\nOkay, so this code snippet here, if you were to just cut and paste this in or type it\ninto your editor then you test it out, fire it up and within five minutes after you've\nstarted the project, you can at least answer HTTP [inaudible 16:12].  And all you've\nwritten here now is really -- you've executed a couple of shell scripts, but you've\nonly written about four or five lines of Python maybe in total. \n\nCreateApp\n\nIn reality, you don't actually create applications by just hard coding the URLs with\nthe patterns to find.  What you really do is you really create a cluster of\nfunctionality that Django calls an application.  I don't like this particular name\nbecause it feels more like a module to me than an application, but nevertheless that's\nthe vocabulary that Django uses.\n\nAnd so what you're really going to want to do is you're going to want to create what\nDjango calls an app and you're going to give it a name.  So in our example here, we're\ngoing to create an app called Buymore.  And so what we do is we use that managed\nscript again, which really just sets the context for executing Python stuff.  So we do\nstart app Buymore and it creates a whole directory structure for us.  It creates model\ncode, it creates views and it creates kind of a skeleton that we can work with and we\ncan add our application logic.  \n\nHomeView\n\nThe other thing that you need to do is, you need to hook that application in using\nyour settings file that it created for you.  You need to reference your Buymore\napplication as an installed application.  And that will mean that Django will go and\nlook for your model code and your view code and your URLs and all that stuff.  It\nknows that that's an integral part of your application that you're building.  So one\nline of code will basically hook up your application into the settings.  \n\nSo now what we've done is we've created a new app called Buymore inside of our Django\napplication.  Now the next trick that we're going to do is we're actually going to\nwrite a view code that will respond to our HTTP request.  And here what we are doing\nis we're going to handle the URL that is blank so you just hit -- if you just type in\nthe top level website domain then this is the URL that you're going to get and you're\ngoing to get the homepage.  And so in this case, we've created an application that has\nexactly one page that it can respond to.  And we've hard coded an HTTP response that\njust replies Mystore contents for that request.  \n\nInterviewer:\tSo URLs maps things to function [codes]?\n\nRespondent:\tYes, it's a regular expression that it parses the regular expression if it --\nit's a stack of regular expressions typically.  And, as soon as it finds the first one\nthat matches then it binds to your Python code that is located in the Buymore application\nin the views file and then inside of views is a function defined as homepage.  And then we\njust have a hard coded response.\n\nInterviewer:\tSo if you wanted to have a custom 404 not found page, would you just put\n[inaudible 19:59] pattern at the very bottom of your stack?\n\nRespondent:\tYes.\n\nInterviewer:\tSo everything else doesn't match you can send it to the...\n\nRespondent:\tAnd so you can do really fancy handling of 404s and all that kind of stuff.\nAnd then in these responses, you can also redirect.  So when you're -- instead of just\nhard coding a HTTP response, you might want to redirect to some other page if you\ndetermine that a certain situation is needed. \n\nSo now we've been able to create a server, create a project, create an application and\nthen create handlers within that application.  Now what we're going to do is we're\ngoing to figure out how to work with data.  So we haven't worked with any data at all.\nWe had just hard coded everything.  \n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\n**Data (9 Tricks)**\nDataBase\nDataBasePostGres\nNewDataModel\nCreateDatabase\nAddRecord\nSaveRecord\nQueryRecords\nShowResults\nDeleteRecord\n\nThe first thing that you will want to do in your application is you're going to want\nto hook to a database.  And in addition to Django shipping with a lightweight server,\nthey also allow you to hook up to a lightweight database.  And so when you're just\nmessing around when you're creating your application, you can create a database in a\nsingle file and then when you're all done then you can basically deploy that and\nreroute that to a more industrial database.  \n\nSo in this case, what we're going to do is we're going to just hook the sequel\n[inaudible 21:34].  And the only that we need to do with [inaudible 21:38] because it\ndoesn't use any user authentication or anything like that, it's just a vocal file on\nyour file system.  The only thing that we need to do is just name the file.  And so\nwe're going to call this thing Hammer DB.\n\nNow later on, you decide that you really need to use postscripts for example, or\nMysequel or any other kind of database that you fancy.  And so here what we do is we\nhave to name the database and then we have to have database access credentials.  And\nso all we do is just change the name of the connection string that we're going to use\nto mount that database.  \n\nAnd typically on web host environments, the database is not located on the same server\nor often times it's not located on the same server that your web application runs on.\nAnd so, no problem; just put the access credentials for the other server.  So we\nchanged three lines of code and all of a sudden we were able to go from a single file\ndatabase to an industrial database.  \n\nOkay, the next thing that we want to do is we want to define our own data types.  And\nthen we want to take these data types and put them in the database as table types.\nAnd so here what we are going to do is we're going to define a class called Note and\nit's going to have two fields.  It's going to have a title and a body and one is going\nto be a fixed [length string] that can go up to a maximum size of 200 and the body is\njust going to be some indeterminate length of text.  And that's all we have to do.\nThree lines of code and now we have a model that we can use.  You put this model into\nthe model's file in your app so in like the Buymore app, if we put the note in there\nthen it's good to go.  \n\nInterviewer:\tDoes it matter what app your data type is declared under since there's\nmultiple models that.\n\nRespondent:\tIt creates tables that contain both the app name and the model name within\nthat and so if you have customers as an app and, if you have orders as a model within that\nthen the table that is created is called customers underscore order.  \n\nNow we're ready to take that model code and generate a database for us.  So you don't\nactually have to write sequel to create the database formats.  All you really have to\ndo is to find the Python code that accesses the data type and then it controls the\ndatabase for you.  So it will actually generate the database.  And the way you do that\nis to do manage by [sync DB] and then that will create all of the missing data tables\nfor you.  \n\nThis is really awesome because, if you're creating data types all the time, they just\nkeep syncing the database and it creates a bunch of stuff for you.  Once you put data\nin the table, it will not modify the database.  You'll have to do that manually.  And\nthere are some tools to help you with that, but the common case is that you're just\ngoing to create a bunch of data.  I typically recreate the database many, many times\nthroughout projects and I will tend to throw it away.\n\nInterviewer:\tOur experience was that we had to create some migration scripts [in order\nto diminish that pie] for when we change the data type of fields instead of the database.\n\nRespondent:\tCorrect.  There's a couple of other great tools that will allow you to\nside-step sequel.  You can dump all of the data in your database as JSON and then you can\nload it back in and so this is a great thing to do if you just want to mess with the data\nor you just want to write transforms that mess with the data and then put it all back in.  \n\nIt's also a great tool that you can use to actually do queries in a form that maybe\nyou want to send out to a front-end client app and you just want to have a job script\non the front-end that manipulates your data.  What you might want to do is just dump a\nbig [hairy] piece of data right out of your database and then just [hype it] to the\ncustomer or to the front-end app that can manipulate.  \n\nThe next thing we want to do is we want to add a record of a particular type.  So this\nis our old friend, the [Note].  It has a title and a body and to add a record, all you\nneed to do is create a blank object just by calling the initializer for a note, set\nthe fields that you want and then save it.  The save is really smart about how to get\nthe data in the right place and whether you have an exception to the data if you're\nmissing a field or something like that.  And then there are also some additional\nvalidation things.  Save will throw an exception and you might want to handle that\nexception if you're not sure if it's valid or not.  But really nice, one line of code\nbasically just smashes your data in the database.\n\nInterviewer:\tWe were using Get or Create, but this is a lot simpler.\n\nRespondent:\tThe next thing you want to do is you may want to modify an object.  So again,\nhere's our friend the Note.  We just get a note and we reset its body and save it.  So\nthat allows you to modify things that already exist in the database or selectively modify\nfields allows you to -- so really to get here is doing a select and then the save is doing\nan update underneath.  But you don't need to worry about that.  You don't need to worry\nabout whether you have one or don't have one or whatever.  This simple pattern here is\ngreat for saving your data. \n\nInterviewer:\tSo will that give you a new blank object with title equals title?\n\nRespondent:\tNo, it will throw an exception and so there is a version of the [getter] that\nwill\n\nOkay, so the next thing that we want to do is we want to go out and list how many\nobjects match a particular thing.  So the first thing we want to do is just enumerate\nall of the objects in the system of particular types.  So we ask for notes -- we ask\nfor note, objects all and this returns a list of all of the matching notes.  \n\nThe next thing we might want to do is we might want to match a particular title when\nwe're looking for something in the database and so, again, this generates a select\nstatement where the title matches the word lost worlds.  And the last case that we\nmight want to do is something more complicated where we're looking for a string in the\ntitle that is greater than some value or it could be a numeric thing.  \n\nAnd Django gives us a really nice list of modifiers that can be used for matching\ncertain kinds of criteria.  So there's greater than, less than, not equal and you can\ndo things like count how many there are and, if the count is bigger than a number, you\ncan do all kinds of things.  So anyway, the sky is the limit.  There's about 34\ndifferent types of modifiers that you can use.  And you can do date ranges and all\nkinds of things.  There's no reason to write sequel.  If you're a sequel-hater like me\nthen Django gives you all the tools that will let you sidestep that.  \n\nThe next thing that you might want to do is you might want to [iterate] through --\nyou've got this query, you get back a bunch of things and now what you want to do is\nyou want to walk the list and print out all the title of the books or all the titles\nof the notes or whatever it is that your database is holding.  \n\nAnd so here's an example of printing out all the notes and it just prints a model, one\nline each as a title and text and it just gives you a nice table of notes.  And so you\ncould imagine wrapping these kinds of things in text tools to do [inaudible 31:57] and\nbasically manage all of your stuff with automated [inaudible].  This kind of stuff is\njust extremely handy for that.  \n\nA more interesting example is you might want to query the database and give back a\ntable of notes and then apply formatting to that because you might want to have your\nweb page, for example, create a table for you.  And what you need is you need a\ntwo-dimensional list of items that then you want to populate in a table.  What this\nallows you to do is a set of generic views, like a table pager that knows nothing\nabout the data that it's holding, but it controls all of the formatting stuff.  \n\nAnd then underneath you have a query function that can generate a table out of the\ncontents that you want to look up, but you don't have any idea how you want to format\nthis.  So this is what we call in the software industry, separation of concerns.  So\nthe formatting of the table is completely independent of the populating of the data in\nthe table.  So here's an example of getting a table out of a database.  One line a\ncode, really nice\n\nThe next thing you might want to do to close out our set of [inaudible 33:38]\noperations is you might want to delete a record.  And so here I've given three\nexamples deleting everything in the database or deleting things that match a specific\ncriteria or a more complicated set of matches and these are essentially the matches\nthat we had before.  So once you've learned these set of operations of how to query\nand how to select certain things then everything that you expect scales out and you\ncan apply any operations.  And here all we're doing is just calling the delete\n[member] function on the \n\nInterviewer:\tSo will this delete underscore note just delete the first entry [inaudible\n34:24].\n\nRespondent:\t[inaudible].  Yes, get only returns one.  Filter returns many.  And that's why\nwe have to iterate the filter list.  This one will actually blow up or throw an exception\nif there is no matching -- the get operation will throw an exception if there is no\nmatching object.\n\nInterviewer:\tBut if there's more than one note with lost worlds as the title it will it\nonly delete the first one? \n\nRespondent:\tGet will have problems with that and so you would use a variant of filter if\nyou thought that there were multiple ones.\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\n**Views (7 Tricks)**\nHomeView\nListViewUrl\nListView\nDetailsView\nFormModel\nAddRecordView\nEditView\nDeleteView\n\nSo now we have the ability to create an application.  We have the ability to\nmanipulate data within that application.  The next set of tricks that we're going to\nexplore is how to build views in our system because after all, we want to build a\nweb-based system and one of the key parts of that is building our views.  \n\nNow these views can be HTML-generated or they could be maybe XML or JSON in the formal\nweb service thing.  I build a lot of web services where you basically can query URLs\nand then have the rendering not be intended for human view, but is just a blob of JSON\ndata that you might want to put on your cell phone or do something like that.  So this\nworks both for front-end services as well as back-end services.  \n\nSo the next that we're going to do is we're going to revisit our friend the home view\nand here what we're doing is we're matching the regular expression that is the\n[inaudible 36:26] string, the beginning and end of line together.  The URL parser has\nthis regular expression language.  It's kind of some nasty syntax, but once you spend\nmaybe an hour trying to figure out how it works, it's not that hard, but when you're\nreading it for the first time, it's kind of offensive, but you'll get used to it.  \n\nSo here we have our old friend the view that we just hard coded to return my store\ncontents.  The next thing that we're going to want to do is we're going to want to\nhave a list of items that we are going to want to display.  And so here we're parsing\nout in addition to the home page, we're parsing out the list URL and mapping that to\nthe Python function list page.  \n\nHere's the implementation of the list page thing.  And this is very typical of the\nkind of thing that you will see is that the function it calls some Python function,\nwhich generates a list of items and then it puts that in a variable called products\nand then it loads a template and the template is a bunch of HTML code that's augmented\nwith some Pythony-stuff, so that I can manipulate the data inside my Python views.  \n\nSo our template here is going to iterate over each of the things in the products list.\nIt's going to call each one P and then it is going to print the label of P both as the\nHREF of the anchor as well as the text that gets displayed to a user.  So what you end\nup with after this runs is a bullet list of all of the products that are linked to the\nindividual pages for those products.  \n\nOkay, the next thing that we want to do is we want to create a details view.  So we\nhave a list of hyperlinks that link to each of the pages for each of our products and\nnow what we want to do is we want to pick of each of the individual products.  And so\nhere we see a more complex syntax for parsing off the argument that's the product ID\nthat we want to display. \n\nAnd so that will be passed into the view, which is called item.  So we have a function\ncalled item and it takes a request and an ID.  And that ID is the variable that got\nparsed off in the URL pattern.  So presumably it's -- and, in fact, it says that it's\na series of digits.  So you're going to say URL with a domain name slash 33 and that's\ngoing to map to an item call in the views [code].  \n\nThen the template that is being used to display this details view is called details\ndot HTML.  And so, in this case, we are passing the ID of the product, which is a --\nI'm rewording this.  Just a minute. \n\nHere what we do is we look up the specific product object out of the database and then\nwe pass that object into the template and then, inside the template, we crack it open\nand we print its primary key, its title, its description or when there were other\nfields it has.  And so this is typical of Django views that there's typically a very\nsmall amount of code that deals with the object types that are being used.  But you\ncan imbed some Python code in the template itself to handle special cases. \n\nOkay, the next thing that we want to do, and I have to say that this is probably the\nmost complicated thing that I'm going to show.  And this is form editing.  And so here\nwhat we're going to do is we're going to pass back data to our view from user input\nand there's several parts to this.  The first part is that we define a form that knows\nwhat edit fields and things like that, that knows what UI to put on our template so\nthat we don't have to write the code that enumerates all of the contents of the class\nthat we want to edit. \n\nSo instead what we do is we define a note form and that note form references the\nactual object type and so it knows that it needs to create a text field for that first\n-- or it needs to create an input field for that first path field in the object type.\nAnd then for the body, it needs to create a text area to match the data type.  And so\nwhat happens is a form comes up on the user interface just that is consistent with the\n-- that is consistent with the object type and we didn't have to define any of the UI\nelements for our specific data type.  All we had to do was create a form that\nreferences the underlying data type. \n\nOkay, in the template part of this, we use this called Form S Table and that is the\nthing that figures out what UI elements need to be present to edit that particular\nkind of a thing.  And the other nasty piece is this cross-site reference and it is --\nI'm going to ignore that for now, but you have to have this to prevent somebody from\ninvoking your form from another website.  This verifies that the creator of this form\nis a legitimate service.\n\nOkay, so we've created the surface area of our form.  Now what we're going to do is\nwe're going to populate this form with data and then we're going to accept that data\nback after the user has typed in the title and body of their note.  And so here what\nyou see is a typical construct where we're using a post-back and there are three cases\nthat we need to handle in our forms.\n\nThe first case is that we have a blank form that we want to present to the user.  And\nso we're adding an element, we're adding a data type to our database and so we put up\na blank form.  The second case is that we have a post-back and the data is good.  And\nthen the third case is that we have a post-back and the data is not good.  It will not\nvalidate and so we can't put it into the database.  And if you analyze this piece of\ncode here, it handles all three of those cases.  In the case where we have valid data\nthen we redirect to the home page and so you could put any redirects in there.  \n\nOkay, now this is the super complicated case because now we have data that we're going\nto put in the form with, by looking up an object in the database.  So they're trying\nto edit note number 33 and so we actually can look up note number 33, put the data\ninto the note then give it back to the user.\n\nInterviewer:\tAs an editable form. \n\nRespondent:\tAs an editable form.  Then when they edit that, then we have the other two\ncases for the post-back that we either have valid or invalid data.  And so this particular\nform handles all of those paths.  \n\nOkay, glad we're through that.  Now for more easy stuff.  We're going to delete based\non accessing a URL.  So here what we need to do is we need to figure out exactly what\nitem we're trying to delete from the database and then just map that to a delete view.\nInside the delete view, what we do is we look up the particular object in the database\nand then we just call its delete function if we found it.  If we didn't find it, we\nprobably don't want to blow up the program. \n\nAnd then, in either case, we're going to redirect to the home view because we just\ndeleted something out of the table.  This could be -- this is typically a list of\nitems and you're going to delete them out of a table of a list and so that's usually\nwhat the code looks like.  And then this, in our list view, I've given a snippet of an\nanchor that will get you that URL.  And so this is an example of how you might put\nthat into your table. \n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\n**Formatting (4 Tricks)**\nPageLayout\nPageTemplate\nStandardNavigation\nJsSupport\n\nOkay, now we're through views.  So we've created our application, we've manipulated\ndata, we've built a set of views.  And so those are all operations that you need to be\nable to work with data in a typical website.  Now what we're going to do is we're\ngoing to style our website.  \n\nOne really nice thing that Django provides is the ability to declare a template that\ncan be used by other templates to set your page styling so you can control the styling\nof your entire website from modifying your single base template.  So in this case,\nI've created a template called layout, not HTML and there's a couple of things that\nyou would typically want to do.  One is I like to use Twitter Bootstrap in all my\nprojects and this gives the site an instant styling without putting any effort into\nit.  And so here, what I've done is I've just imbedded the libraries, the library\nreferences to Twitter Bootstrap right here on my base page and then all the other\npages get it for free.  \n\nThe other thing that you typically do is you have some area of content that you want\neach page to override.  And so Django gives you the ability to define blocks and then\na default handling of those blocks.  So if in the inside of this block here, this\nblock content, I provided a bunch of HTML and then the page that extends this layout,\nif it doesn't redefine that HTML, if it doesn't provide its own version of that block\nthen you get the default.  So that's kind of nice for having some default behavior\nlike no content goes here or something like that.  It's a handy way to do that.  \n\nOkay and then this is a trick where we're going to extend that template and utilize\nthat in the context of our project.  And so here what we've done is we've defined a\nblock content, which has a title on each one and then it has an unordered list of\nitems for a number of different directories or a number of different files.  So this\nis basically -- this construct appears in every program that I've ever written because\nsomewhere in there, you're going to deal with a list of stuff and so this is basically\nhow you walk the list and paint all the references. \n\nAnd you can see that each one of those individual references then is an anchor with an\nHREF and text that match the content of the directory listing.  And so basically,\nyou're just passing on a list of items and then they get painted by a few lines of\ncode like that.  So that kind of construct you'll see in almost every application your\nwrite. \n\nOkay, another nice thing that this allows us to do is to define our site level\nnavigation.  And so here what I've done is I've used the Twitter Bootstrap nav bar for\ncreating a set of links that I want to have specific kinds of information.  And so\nthis kind of a construct would appear in your layout HTML and then every page would\nautomatically get that without redefining that construct.  So this gives you one place\nto define things.  It makes your code really clean. \n\nAnother thing that you might want to do is you might want to provide some front-end\njob script manipulation.  So in this case what I've done is just referenced a [J]\nquery library and then I don't really have to do anything else and now all of a sudden\nI can manipulate front-end objects in all my pages if this were in the base page. \n\nOkay, now we've got styling in our application.  The next thing that we need to work\non is getting documents.  \n\nInterviewer:\tWe're doing this as [inaudible 53:01] can be really nice if you show what\nthe applets look like so far. \n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\n**Document (6 Tricks)**\nBrowseDirectory\nReadFile\nWriteFile\nExecuteScript\nTextToHtml\nSearchText\n\nRespondent:\tOkay now we're going to work on a set of tricks dealing with manipulating\ndocuments.  The first thing that I always do when I learn a new programming language is I\nalways figure out how to be able to walk the file system because I often need to\nmanipulate either directories or files in the file system.  And so this is one of the\nfirst things that I always need to do.  \n\nAnd so here we see an example of a directory listing where we give the directory name\non the URL.  We map that to a function in the views code called list view and then,\ninside list view, we take in that path name that came in through the URL and we go out\nand enumerate the contents of that particular directory, stick it in a Python variable\ncalled files, hand it off to our template, who knows how to paint a list of files.  So\nin roughly less than 10 lines of code, we have now created a file listing interface to\nour application.  \n\nOkay, the next thing that we're going to want to do is we're going to want to open one\nof those files and reading all the text.  And so here's an example of how you would\nwant to do that.  We take in the URL that names the file, we map that URL to a\nfunction called read view in the views [class].  Then inside of read view, we open the\ncontents of that path and then we read all of the characters out of that and we stick\nit in a variable called text.  And then we have a template that we just hand text to\nand it paints all that.  So here we have roughly six lines of code and we have the\nability to display a file in HTML, assuming the file is HTML. \n\nWriting is just about the same and here what we've done is we have created a log\nfunction so that every time I hit a page, I want to record the fact that I hit that\npage.  And so I've created a function called log that I can imbed in all of my\ndifferent views that will keep a history of page hits in a text file on my machine.\nAnd the way it does that is it appends to a file and it formats the date of the hit\nand then which user was logged in and then the name of the page that they were\nhitting.  So that's all imbedded in this log function.  \n\nAnd then I could use that log function in any view that -- just to create a passive\nlogger so that I can get a history of all of the activity on my website.  So you don't\nnecessarily need to imbed a heavyweight logging tool, you can just build your own\nlogging in roughly four or five lines of code. \n\nInterviewer:\tSo how does this get then passed on to the page that you're requesting\nbecause I though URLs only looked for the first match on the regular expression. \n\nRespondent:\tThis URL is going to map to the record view thing and then record view is just\ngoing to return home.  In fact, its on -- this is basically going to double hop your\nthing.  Its not actually going to do anything useful.  It's just going to redirect to some\nother page.  But what I was really trying to illustrate is not the handler for that, but\nhow easy it is to imbed logging in other views.  Presumably you have some more interesting\nlogic that you want, but in just a few lines of code, you could write a custom logger. \n\nInterviewer:\tOkay.  You're not demonstrating how to double intercept.  \n\nRespondent:\tCorrect.  Okay, the next thing that we might want to do is we might want to\nexecute shell commands.  In this example, what I've done is I've allowed certain scripts\nto be run and I look up those scripts and I execute them because they are shell scripts.  \n\nAnd so here what I'm doing is I'm taking in URLs where the command is a part of the\nURL name and then I'm executing the file using this [P] open and giving it -- I'm\nsupplying the command name and then I'm taking all of its output and passing it back\nto the [caller].  And so here what I'm doing is I'm actually invoking some command and\nthen I'm going to create a page that shows both the command and the result of\nexecuting that command.  Again, very few lines of code and its the magic of Python\nthat's really giving us this huge leverage factor.  \n\nAnother thing that I typically do in virtually all the programs that I write is I want\nto do some formatting and I have some fairly sophisticated tools that deal with things\nlike wiki formatting and extracting hyperlinks and maybe I want to write some tools\nthat actually do some remote lookups and maybe do some command execution or whatever. \n\nSo typically what I have is I have all my pages go through a command that can be\narbitrarily sophisticated and has nothing to do with the web infrastructure.  So I ran\nmy websites so that they deal with web pages and URLs in all of the infrastructure\nabout dealing with the web, I concentrate in one, but all my business logic, I have\nisolated in worker functions that may have a different lifecycle than the rest of the\napplication.  \n\nAnd so here's an example of that type of a thing.  The way that I paint a document on\nthe screen is I call this function format document that may do a bunch of arbitrary\nthings and one of the things that it may do is invoke an external program that does a\nbunch of stuff that my web system knows nothing about.  What it does know is that, by\nthe time this wiki HTML format command is done, its going to produce a block of output\nand then I'm going to pass that block of output onto the web page for display.  \n\nBut this allows you to build a system that is very, very decoupled and so that you can\nchange your business rules and it has zero impact on your web base infrastructure,\nvery important for the long life of the system. \n\nAnother thing that's really handy to do is you might want to search all the objects in\nyour database for a particular piece of text.  And so here's just a simple example of\ngetting all the filters -- getting all of the objects by filtering them, based on\nwhether the name contains the word, Bill.  And so this one thing will give you all the\nBills in the system and then that's being passed on to the template as a variable\ncalled people.  \n\n**Users (7 Tricks)**\nAdminImage\nAdminInterface\nUserLogin\nEnforcingSecurity\nDetailsImage\nEditUser\nListUsers\n\nOkay, now we have built an application, we've been able to work with data, we've been\nable to work with views, construct views, we've been able to style those views and now\nwe've been able to manipulate the underlying file system and work with documents. \n\nNow we're ready to work with user authentication.  There's really two parts that we\nwant to do.  The first is that we want to authorize a particular user.  We want to --\nthere's two parts to working with users.  The first part is to authenticate that a\nparticular -- that we know who a particular user is.  The second part is to allow them\na certain level of privilege and that's called authorization.\n\nDjango provides both of these facilities with great ease.  In about two lines of code,\nyou can enable a whole user auth system that has amazingly good capabilities; very\nnice, secure, robust, easy to implement and turn on.  And I highly recommend not\nbuilding your own user authentication system, but just enabling the one that is\nprovided to you.  \n\nAt its base level, it gives you a number of objects that you have a nice user\ninterface too so you can manage the users in your system.  And this is how you turn on\nthe user auth system.  The first thing that you need to do is include the access to\nthe import libraries and then the next thing that you need to do is tell Django that\nyou're using the built-in authentication system and then the last thing that you need\nto do is you need to map all the URLs that start with admin to be handled by the\nbuilt-in library.  That's all you need to do.  So all you're really telling it is\nevery time somebody types in a URL that starts with admin, it must be for you and then\nyou get all this user interface for free.  \n\nHere's an example of adding login and logout to your application.  So here what we're\ndoing is we're picking off the login and logout URLs and then we just map them to the\ndefault handling of those same functions.  So we don't actually have to provide any\nuser interface or anything and all of the business rules about what happened with a\nfailed login and resetting my password and I forgot my password and email me so that I\ncan get a reset link, all of that stuff is done for you.  You don't have to do any\nwork to do that. \n\nOkay, this is an example of the authorization piece.  Here what we're doing is we're\ngoing to require that, if you hit the home page that you have to be logged in in order\nto see the home page.  And what that decorator does, the login required decorator is\nthat, if you are not authenticated when you hit the home page, you'll be mapped\nautomatically.  You'll be redirected to the login screen.  Again, one line of code and\nnow all of a sudden, we have checking. \n\nAnd so you can have certain views that can be universally accessed, but you add the\nlogin required decorator anyplace in your system where you decide that you want to\ncontrol permissions.  And there are a number of other decorators' variations on this\nthat allow you to -- only allow super users to have access to this or only require a\nspecific user or user group privileges to be able to do certain things. \n\nOne of the things that I love about Django is that easy things are easy and hard\nthings are possible and that's the right combination.  Easy things should be trivial.  \n\nOkay now what we're going to do here is we are going to be able to look at not only\nall of the built-in types that Django has that they have offered for us that they\nautomatically put in our database, but we are wanting to get nice customized views of\nour specific data types.  So for example, the note thing that we created, once we've\ncreated that data type, now we can edit that data type, automatically writing zero\nadditional code. \n\nSome of the data types for the built-in things are really sophisticated.  For example,\nyou can see in this edit box for the user that they have [salting] of the passwords\nand they have the forgot my password thing and there's a whole bunch of business\nlogic.  There's probably thousands of lines of code implementing business logic that\nyou have no business re-implementing yourself when a team of experts did that for you.  \n\nAnd then another nice thing is that any tables can be shown as a list and so that you\ncan drill down in and you can look at all of the fields across all of your different\ndata types, which is built-in user interface stuff, again, writing no code at all.\nAll you did was hook up the admin interface. \n\nOkay, so now we've got user authentication in our system and we've written about five\nlines of code total to get all of these rough indication stuff looked up.  It also\nsaved us many, many hours, maybe a month's worth of hard work. \n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\n**Project (5 Tricks)**\nTricksInventory\nEstimateCost\nTestDrivenDevelopment\nHostYourApp\nDeployApp\n\nOkay now the last set of tricks that we're going to look at is some global project\nmanagement tricks.  And this kind of takes advantage of the capabilities of Django,\nbut is not necessarily specific to Django.  \n\nThe first trick that I recommend is that you analyze your next project and you\nactually do an inventory of all of the tricks that you're going to need.  Then you're\ngoing to -- and many times when people first start analyzing a project, they end up\nwith big tasks that need to be done.  I would say break those tasks down until you can\nget down to the level of identifying specific tricks.  And so you want to keep\ndecomposing until you feel like I can do this in an hour if I knew the trick.  \n\nThen do an inventory of how many times you've used that trick already.  If you've\napplied a specific trick five or six times, it will probably only take you an hour.\nBut if you've never done that trick before then you have to factor in both the\nlearning, as well as the doing.\n\nInterviewer:\tIts probably a day.\n\n\nRespondent:\tIt will probably take you a day the first time and every time you do a trick,\nyou can cut that time in half, down to about an hour.  So then you can estimate the\ncost just by rolling those things out.  You can take how many tricks that you've got,\nfigure out how many tricks you already know.  You can apply a trick in an hour, learn\nthe trick in a day.  So that gives you a really accurate estimate.  \n\nSo this is a typical project that I work on is that it has 50 tricks.  I know 40 of\nthem.  So it's going to take me about 40 hours to apply the tricks I already know.\nBut there's 10 tricks that I don't know yet.  Those 10 tricks are going to take me\ntwice the amount of time as the 40 tricks that I already know and that's typical of a\nproject.  So what this says is that two-thirds of my time spent on this project is\ngoing to be learning what I don't know already.  \n\nThe next thing that I highly recommend is use test-driven development.  Accelerate\nyour project by creating a process of rapid iteration.  And when I mean rapid, I think\nyou should be able to add a new feature every five minutes.  And so what you want to\nfind is how to create on line of code to add a new feature and to create one line of\ncode to add a new test and then what you want to do is you want to write your test\nbefore you write your code.  \n\nThis is not hard because you're only writing one line of test code and then you're writing\none line of product code and you should be able to turn that wheel in about five minutes.\nTest hourly,daily and weekly at different levels of depth and then deploy all of your code\nonly when the testpassed.  There's no point in deploying bad code.  And, if you haven't\ntested it, it is bad code.\n\nSo the next thing is host your web application.  The first time that you have to host\nan application, it will probably take about a day.  And after that, you can probably\ndeploy your app in an hour.  While I like a web host called WebFaction, they have very\ncheap sites and you can set them up and get going very quickly.  They have control\npanel, operations that allow you to set up the URLs and map them and they create a\nstatic server for you to serve up your images and JavaScript libraries and thingslike\nthat.  And so it's a largely point-and-click and then they allow you to bind yourweb\napplication to specific domains.  One of the tricks that I like is I have many\ndifferent domains serve off the same web application.  So I have one app thatserves\nprobably 20 different domains.\n\nThe next thing that you want to do is you want to deploy your application.  So I\nreally like a tool called Get that allows me to create a new repository by calling\n[Getanet] to check-in everything that's been modified, added or deleted, with one\ncommand, where you get commit.  And then I can push my application to share with the\nrepository or any other people that are using that repository with a single command\ncode get push and then I can do that remotely.  I can redeploy my application by just\ndoing SSA [inaudible 01:15:36] get pull. \n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\n**Follow Up**\nSourceCode\nHelpMe\nDjangoDocs\nRelatedTopics\n\nAll of the source code that I've showed is on my GitHub repository and the slide\npresentation is located on my website.

I thought it might be\na useful here as a resource for epublishing Newbies, as well as other writers who have questions and\ncontributions.  For those whove been around awhile, you may want to skip to the second posting on\nPromotion.\n\nThis is a fact: Epublishing is revolutionizing publishing, an event no less important to\nintellectual discourse than the penny newspapers of the nineteenth century.\n\nEpublishing is a viable option to seeking a traditional publisher.  Not only are established writers\npublishing original material to Kindle (and other ebook platforms), but indie writers are being\noffered traditional DTB (dead tree book) contracts based on their ebooks.  While the ebook market is\nstill only 9% of the total book market (as of 10/2010), it is a growing market.  Consumers are\nexpected to buy one billion dollars in ebooks by the end of the year.  So lets get aboard.\n\n**HOW TO GET STARTED**\n\nThere is no charge to upload your manuscript to Amazon Kindle (or any of the other ebook platforms,\nincluding Smashwords, PubIt, Kobo, iPad, Borders, Android, Sony, and Diesel). You do not have to own\na Kindle to publish on Kindle. You do not have to own a Kindle to read Kindle books (there is a free\ndownload application for your computer on the Amazon website).\n\nThere are a handful of simple steps. Prepare your manuscript, then proof and format it to\nperfection. Prepare your sales pitch, design a cover, decide on a price. Once you have these\nelements together, it takes only about one hour per venue. You can finish writing a novel on Monday,\npost it on Tuesday, and start making money on Friday (it takes a few days for Amazon to process it).\n\nFor Kindle, it is easier if you have a U.S. bank. Smashwords pays through PAYPAL, and is therefore\nmore international.  Kindle pays monthly, Smashwords pays quarterly.\n\n**PREPARING YOUR MANUSCRIPT**\n\n**1. COPY EDITING.** Have several people proof your work. Have at least three people (preferably fellow\nwriters) read your manuscript for typos.  And/or hire a professional (which will cost $300 \n$1,000). If you need or want an editor, someone who chops and cuts and moves material around, and\nquestions you about word choice, narrative flow, storyline, etc., that will run from $2,000-$8,000,\nand will take two weeks to a month.\n\nDo an Edit/Find on redundant and passive words, such as that, starts and begins, of the,\nturned, the phone and some of the, was and were.\n\nIf you cannot afford a copy editor, here's another technique several indies have employed.  Transfer\nyour book file to your Kindle and use the text to speech.  Read along with a hard copy of your\nmanuscript.  You'll be astonished by what you catch.  Very helpful and costs nothing.\n\nNOTE: Kindle, Smashwords, and most ereaders allow readers to download a sample before buying your\nbook. Most readers will do this, SO MAKE THE BEGINNING OF YOUR BOOK FABULOUS. It must read so a\nperson is intrigued, has to know more, will not sleep until he reads more.\n\n\n**2. Create a Word file** \n\nPut all of your files into one Microsoft Word document (including title page), single spaced,\njustified. Times Roman or Arial font, or something simple. (Not courier.) Many prefer using the EPUB\nfile format. See Christian Cantrells Blog below.  Before you upload to Kindle, check your\nformatting as Amazon converts it using HTML.\n\nMake sure you have no tabs.  Do an Edit Replace for ^t, replacing it with nothing. Then highlight\nyour entire document, and use the Format, Paragraph, Indent first line feature.  (Or you can double\nspace between paragraphs.)\n\nKindle is much more flexible about format than Smashwords, but to save you from formatting your\nmanuscript twice, you might want to abide by Smashword rules (which you can read at Smashwords.com).\nTitles and headings should not be larger than 18 pitch.\n\n\n**3. Add copyright**  After your title page, you want to put something like:\n\nDigital Edition Copyright  2010 by Author Name All rights reserved\n \nThe  symbol supposedly protects the text internationally. As I understand it, as soon as you've\ncreated a text, it's copyrighted in the U.S., but that allows you only the ability to stop\nrepublication by someone else. If you register the copyright with the Library of Congress, you are\nable to collect money damages. For more information, see http://copyrightregistery-gov-form.com/\n\nIf a publisher reads what you have on Kindle, and wants to do a DTB (dead tree book), you have all\nrights to sell it to them. I know of several indies who have found publishers this way.\n\n\n**4. Save as HTML** \n\nWhen you are done formatting, SAVE AS a web page (HTML). This is the document you will want to\nupload to Kindle.\n\n\n**5. Create cover** \n\nA great cover does a lot to sell a book. You can design your own with free online photos and a photo\nmanipulation program. Photoshop is great but expensive. Gimp is free. An excellent list of websites\nwhere you can download free photos is: http://www.photoshopsupport.com/resources/stock-photos.html\n\nYou want the title and author name to be really big, with a single intriguing image. A light cover,\nletters at least 1/4 the size of the cover, lots of red. Yellow is good for title. (Look at a Kindle\nbook called THIN BLOOD, a brilliant cover.)\n\nWhile you are working on your cover, reduce the image at times to 1-1/4 inch highthis is about how\nbig it will appear on the computer. If it doesnt pop out at you, or isnt easily read, change it.\n\n\n**6. Create Blurb** You need to write a short synopsis, not more than 400 words. Shorter is better. Give\nthe synopsis to friends and ask if theyd be intrigued enough to read the book.\n\nSHORT BLURB: You need to write a very short synopsis of 400 characters. This shorter version youll\nneed for Smashwords, and for self-promotion on blogs and websites.\n\nSpend serious time on these synopses. This, apart from your cover, is your main sales tool.\n\n\n**7. PRICING:**\n\nA lot of writers first post their books for .99 cents because a number of Kindle readers routinely\nbuy only .99 books. It is a way to get a following. Think of it as an introductory price. The\nminimum for which you can get at 70% royalty is $2.99, which is why many indie Kindle books are\n$2.99. The DTB publishers often list their books at $9.99 or higher because they can. Many writers\nthink it's the DTB publishers way to suppress the ebook market, and to maintain a demand for\nDTBs. But readers have made it clear on the forums that they think it is unfair to post an ebook for\nmore than a paperback.\n\nIn other words, $9.99 is probably too much for an indie ebook. Keep it under $5.00.\n\nAt some point you might want to change your price. If, for instance, you post at .99 cents and it\nsells like crazy, getting you to the top 100 Kindle Best Sellers list, you might want to keep it at\n.99 cents until you drop off. (The big deal about the top 100 is that it is a visible list that is\npromoted by Amazon. A major goal is to get on this list.) But if you are not making a lot of sales\nat .99 cents, you might as well go to $2.99 for awhile. I've had books that began to sell more when\nI raised the price.\n\nThere is no stigma for .99 books on Amazon. DTB Publishers sometimes run very cheap specials (or\nfree) for their best sellers. Everyone, in other words, is trying to find a good price point.\n\nAnother technique--Amazon will \"discount\" your book if it is being sold cheaper elsewhere. You can\nsell it lower at Smashwords, or keep it the same and sign up for distribution at Kobo, which\nautomatically discounts. Then Amazon will slash your price from say $2.99 to $2.39. People will\nthink they are getting a deal. You'll simply have to test out what works best for you.\n\n\n**8. UPLOADING:**\n\nYou are ready to upload. There are a number of websites you can upload your ebook. Kindle,\nSmashwords, PubIt, etc.  Kindle is the best, so well start with that.\n\nGo to https://dtp.amazon.com/mn/signin\n\nRegister, then follow directions.\n\n-Upload book and synopsis. Set price. Remember, you may want to start with a promotional price of\n.99 for two weeks, then move to $2.99 where you'll get the 70 percent royalty\n\n-Be sure to preview your book. It is laborious, but necessary.\n\n-Add your bank account information with electronic routing number. If you are unsure about your wire\nrouting number, call your bank.\n\n-Follow directions and add tags, categories, and other information.\n\n-Kindle takes several days to upload your book, and will send you an email when it is\ncomplete. While you wait, start working on your marketing strategy.\n\n\n**9. CHANGES**:\n\nAt any point after you have published, you CAN make changes. You can change the\nprice. You can make editorial changes and upload again. You can change your cover and\nsynopsis. Amazon may take your book offline for up to 48 hours, so you dont want to do this\nexcessively, but it is hugely comforting to know that once its gone to print, its not carved in\nstone.\n\n**10. BACKLIST TITLES**\n\nMany authors are uploading to Kindle previously published books when they get their rights back. You\nneed a letter from your publisher confirming Reversion of Rights. Upload your book. Within a few\ndays, Amazon will contact you and ask you to scan in your letter and send it to them. Within four or\nfive days, your book will be approved.\n\n-Smashwords does not require such a letter.\n\n\n**11. Barnes & Noble** \nhas recently established an epublication website, PubIt. It works much the same as Kindle:\nhttp://pubit.barnesandnoble.com/pubit_app/bn?t=pi_reg_home&code=4aa51434099049dc9bbb6f75872a952f\n\n\n**12. AMAZON KINDLE for UK WRITERS:**\nYou have to join on the USA site with your UK password if you are already a customer, and when you\ncreate your account it has US and UK buttons to turn on or off.\n\nUK royalty is 30% regardless of where you are. They send a check in . If it is sold in US then they\nsend a check for 70% (if it is between $2.99 and $9.99).  They only send checks when it is over\n$100, and will charge you $8 per check.  \n\n\n**13. PROMOTION:**\n\nThe most difficult part about selling ebooks is getting the word out about them.\n\nFor my first Kindle book \"Amsterdam 2012\", I mentioned it on the Amazon Kindle forum and here on\nKindleboards.com. That was it. And it took off, selling over 1,000 copies the first weekend. Most\npromotion is word of mouth--doing guest postings on other writers' blogs, finding interest groups\nand pitching your book (e.g., if you have a book about dogs, pitching it to websites for dog\nlovers), participating in various writers groups, reviewing other writers' works. The self-promotion\nis time-intensive, and, yes, annoying. But even traditional publishers insist their writers do a lot\nof self-promotion on their own (my last publisher asked me to hire a publicist!) There are some\nwebsites that review ebooks only. Soon there will be established review venues. Right now everyone\nis kind of flying by the seat of their britches.\n\nAUTHOR COMMUNITIES to Join and to Promote Your Books:\n\n- Kindleboards.com. Sign up and promote your book on the Bizarre forum. Participate in as many\ndiscussions as you have time for. Post questions if you want. Everyone is very helpful. These boards\nlist a lot of other venues where you can advertise your book.\n\n-Amazon Kindle, Discussions, Kindle Forum. There are several threads where you can plug your\nbook. Let friends know about where youve plugged your book, so they can comment on your remark and\nkeep it on the first page of comments. This helps enormously in sales. I do not recommend posting a\nnew thread about your book, although many do. Several trolls are very harsh to writers who hog\nthe forum for self-promotion. Use this venue with caution.\n\n-Goodreads.com. Become a member and promote your book. If you spend time on their discussion boards\nand make \"friends\", they can be really helpful.\n\n-Nookboards.com. Become a member and promote your book.\n\n-Soundings:Puget Sound Speaks. Promote on Board Index, Independent authors\n\n-Mobileread.com. Become a member and promote your book on the authors promotion thread.\n\n-Librarything.com. Become a member and promote your book.\n\n-shelfari.com.\n\n-Redroom.com.  Become a member and post blogs entries and stories.  They have weekly writing\nchallenges that are widely read.\n\n-NOTE: Whenever you see that one of your author \"friends\" has a post on the Kindle Forums, chime in,\nor ask them a question so they can respond, further bumping their thread. They will do the same for\nyou. You can follow these forums--Amazon will send you an alert, if you want, every time someone\nposts.\n\nAUTHOR BLOGS and REVIEW SITES: Here You Can Ask to Have Your Book Reviewed or be a Guest Blogger:\n\nhttp://theindiespotlight.blogspot.com/ Fill out their author's interview questionnaire. They will post your book in about 3 weeks.\nhttp://indiebooksblog.blogspot.com/\nhttp://spaldings-racket.blogspot.com/\nhttp://redadeptreviews.com/\nhttp://simon-royle.com\nhttp://dailycheapreads.com\nhttp://candysraves.com\nhttp://bookbuzzr.com\nhttp://thefrugalereader.blogspot.com\nhttp://hf-connection.com  (Historical Fiction Connection)\nhttp://booksontheknob.blogspot.com\nhttp://kindle-author.blogspot.com\nhttp://coffeeandroses.blogspot.com\nhttp://bellaonline.com\nhttp://trishasbookshelf.blogshopt.com\nhttp://paperbackdolls.blogspot.com\nhttp://www.kindleobsessed.com/\nhttp://thecajunbooklady.com\nhttp://theunreadreader.com\nhttp://kindlereader.blogspot.com\nhttp://twoendsofthepen.blogspot.com\nhttp://tinasbookreview.com\nhttp://rexreadingrobot.com\nhttp://cherylsbooknook.blogspot.com\nhttp://myreadingroom-crystal.blogspot.com\nhttp://lostforwords-corrine.blogspot.com\nhttp://www.jennsbookshelves.com/\nhttp://www.booksandchat.net/\nhttp://www.thenovelblog.com/\nhttp://kindlehomepage.blogspot.com Kindle Nation Daily, a promotional site. Promotional blitzes start at $59.\nhttp://www.kindleboards.com also has a daily paid promotion available.\n \nSimon Royle has another good list at:  \nhttp://www.simon-royle.com/indie-reviewers\n\nScott Nicholson has a good list from his blog tour (emphasis on horror reviewers):\nhttp://www.hauntedcomputer.com/booktour.htm\n\nThere are many, many more. Many are mentioned here on Kindleboards.com from time to time. It is a\nquestion of networking and favors, but this shared promotion is invaluable.\n\nOther Promotional Tools to Know About:\n\n- Tagging. On your book page on Amazon, there is a place where you can list \"tags\" or key words that\nhelp people find your book. Add tags, then go to Kindleboards and ask fellow writers to tag your\nbook. This will get your book up on the rankings for specific types of books. Very important.\n\n- Author Page on Amazon. Amazon now gives you an author page where you can write about anything you\nwant to promote yourself. Put up a picture and stuff about yourself. You need to set up a separate\npage for Amazon UK.\n\n-Facebook and Twitter. Lots of writers use Facebook to promote their books. Become a fan of other\nwriters on FB, and they will do the same.\n\n-If you have published DTBs, do a book giveaway on Goodreads.com.\n\n-Blog tours.  Contact all of the sites you would like to appear on, and ask to be a guest blogger\nduring a specific promotion period.  Line them all up, get your blogs prepared, and promote your\ntour.  Several authors have sponsored a Kindle raffle for viewers.\n\n-Some authors have tried listing their book as an ebook on CD on Ebay.  The Ebay listing costs $.50\nfor a 30 day listing.  Add S&H costs.  The object here is not so much to sell CDs but to entice\nKindle owners to see the book and then check for the book on Amazon.\n\n**14. READER REVIEWS:**\nReader Reviews are key to selling books.\n\n-You can ask for reviews on Kindleboards.\n\n-You can go to authonomy.com and post part or all of your book. When people comment on it, you can\nask them to post their review on Amazon.\n\n-Many reviewers on Amazon make their emails available. You can send them an email and ask them to\nreview your book--sending them a free version or a Smashwords coupon.\n\n-Amazon ranks Kindle books. Your goal is to get in the top 100, because there is a list of best\nsellers which gives you wide visibility.\n\n-Once you start getting reviews, keep a list of people who liked it, and then email them about your\nnext book.\n\n-Facebook. Ask for reviews from your FB fans.\n\n-Start a blog. If you can figure out something to say once a week (or every day) that people want to\nhear, you draw a lot of folk. Quite a few writers have started blogs where other writers can promote\ntheir works.\n\n-Reviewing other peoples books is a good way to get your book reviewed.\n\n-Youtube. Lots of people are doing book trailers on Youtube. So far, the time, money, and effort\ninvested in book trailers has not translated into huge sales for most writers.\n\n-It's all about connections and relationships. Doing little favors for people, and they returning\nlittle favors.\n\n\n**15. PAYMENT:**\n\nKindle pays 70% royalties on books $2.99 to $9.99. For books .99-$2.99, and over 9.99\nthe royalty is 35%. Payment is 60 days after the close of the month. Smashwords pays 70% through\nPaypal and quarterly (unless it is sold through another outlet through Smashwords). PubIt: Books\nbelow $2.99: 40%; Books from $2.99 - $9.99: 65%; Books over $9.99: 40%\n\nIf you're in the US, that minimum in royalties is $10.00 for payment to a bank account, and $100.00\nif you want them to cut you a check. If you do require a check, then they charge an $8.00 fee out of\nthat before they pay you.\n\n\n**16. COUPON:** \n\nSmashwords allows you to create coupons for your books. You can give this virtual coupon (a number)\nto anyone, and they can use it to buy your book on Smashwords. You can do a promotional \"giveaway\"\nor \"contest\", posting it on forums and websites.\n\n\n**17.  OTHER RESOURCES:**\n\nAn excellent resource for epublishing is J.A. Konraths, The Newbies Guide to Publishing, only\n$2.99.\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Newbies-Publishing-Everything-Writer-ebook/dp/B003I6496Y\n\nJoes blog, http://www.jakonrath.blogspot.com, is also very informative, and very inspiring.\n\nAlso, adobe expert Christian Cantrells Blog is helpful:\nhttp://www.livingdigitally.net/2010/09/everything-you-need-to-know-about-how-to-digitally-self-publish.html\n\n\n**18. NOTE:** \n\nDon't try to do it all at once. Work an hour or two a day on your book upload. Format it one\nday. Spend two days on the cover. One day for your synopsis. One day for uploading it. Once it is\nup, spend a half hour a day promoting it. First on Kindleboards, Mobilereads, Nookboards. Isn't that\nbetter than fretting about your &$&## agent, or the piles of rejection letters?\n\nRemember, once it is up, you start making money immediately. You ARE a published writer who is\nmaking money. Now isn't that what you always wanted?\n\n\nSee also [[Writing]]\n\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Kindle Publishing"}}, {"pk": 985, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/2012Timeline", "time": "2014-06-15T20:39:21.323", "text": "* 2012 Timeline *                 -*-muse-*-\n\nJan\n    travel to Dave Seaman's 80th birthday\n    replace furnance and A/C \n    finish 5.9 watermill software release\n    began work on budgeting model\n    began meeting with Tim Musselwhite    \n    Seaman's Log (weekly articles)\n    quarterly personal retreat\n    start home group\n    men's breakfast\n    command clusters\nFeb\n    brain tools and scripts\n    weekly Skype with Rachel and Hoods\n    focus on Spiritual Transformation\n    began updating watermills\n    Sam pregnant\n    music manager\n    learning agenda and knowledge managment\n    learn about self-publishing\n    automation for invoices\n    programming project with Josiah\n    PGP for document security\n    HOA web site\n    build time and money budget model\n    Josiah starts with migraines\nMar\n    Prayer Journal and Practices\n    tomboy notes\n    turn key linux\n    best practices and automation web sites\n    mybook automation and tools\n    50 tricks\n    most of code moved onto new server\n    replicated MyBook web sites\n    started tracking time allocation\n    turmoil starts at Banner (optimization)\nApr\n    create automatic test framework for Watermills\n    form editing for list sign up\n    automatic facebook post app\n    linked in profile and links\n    Christine works for Eric\n    file tax return\n    Dr Ebens\n    start on tech team at church\n    buy ultra book\nMay\n    meeting with Bryan and Kevin\n    trust ramp\n    Lean Startup -

This is the\npublic persona that I construct and present to others.\n\n**Private Self**\nMy private thoughts and inner feelings are not shared with others,\nbecause it is believed to be safer that way.  This is different with\neach person.  There are people that I share most thing with, resulting\nin a small private self.  Others I share very little with for lack of\ntrust.  This makes for a large private self.\n\nBeware of those areas that you are unwilling to share with anyone.\nYou should be able to share almost anything with someone.  Also beware\nof discrepencies between the private and public identities.  This is\nopportunity for self-destruction.\n\n**Revealed Self**\nThis areas is the home of my blind spots.  I cannot see these thing\neven though everyone else can. It is important to be in close enough\nrelationships that others can help us to identify the blind\nspots. Then we can allow God to help us integrate those things into\nour lives. \n\n**Unknown Self**\nSometimes there are mysteries that we don't understand.  We do things\nthat we cannot explain.  We feel a certain way about something that\ndefies an explanation.  During prayer God can begin revealing these\nthings to us.  Then he brings healing and restoration.\n\nSee also [[Brain]]\n\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Parts Of Self"}}, {"pk": 1007, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/IssueTracker", "time": "2014-06-15T20:39:25.831", "text": "* Issue Tracker *                 -*-muse-*-\n\nSimple system to record support issues\n\n**Object Model**\nOpen\nClose\nTitle\nUnit\nOwner\nNotes\n\n**Views**\nOpen\nAll\nDetail\nAdd\nEdit\nDelete\n\nSee also [[Watermill]]\n\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Issue Tracker"}}, {"pk": 1008, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/SendHtml", "time": "2014-06-15T20:39:26.022", "text": "* Send Html *                 -*-muse-*-\n\nThis text is the body of an email message received at gmail.\n\n\n\n<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n<html xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" lang=\"\" xml:lang=\"\" \n    >\n<head>\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=EmulateIE7\" />\n    <title>\n     Thinking  - * Shrinking World Solutions *\n</title>\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" \n          href=\"http://shrinking-world.org/media/admin/css/base.css\" />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"http://shrinking-world.org/media/mybook/css/shrinking-world.css\" />\n    \n    <!--[if lte IE 7]>\n        <link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" \n            href=\"http://shrinking-world.org/media/admin/css/ie.css\" />\n        <![endif]\n    -->\n    \n    \n    <meta name=\"robots\" content=\"NONE,NOARCHIVE\" />\n        <!-- Update your html tag to include the itemscope and itemtype attributes -->\n    <html itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Blog\">\n\n      <!-- Add the following three tags inside head -->\n      <meta itemprop=\"name\" content=\"Seaman's Log\">\n      <meta itemprop=\"description\" content=\"Helping you thrive in the modern world.\">\n      <meta itemprop=\"image\" content=\"http://markseaman.org/media/mybook/images/Mark.Seaman.200.jpg\">\n</head>\n\n\n<body class=\"\">\n  <div id=\"fb-root\"></div>\n  <script>(function(d, s, id) {\n    var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n    if (d.getElementById(id)) return;\n    js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;\n    js.src = \"//connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js#xfbml=1\";\n    fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);\n    }(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));</script>\n\n    <!-- Container -->\n    <div id=\"container\">\n        \n\n        <!-- Header -->\n        <div id=\"header\">\n            <div id=\"branding\">\n                \n    <div  style='float:left'>\n      \n      <h1 id=\"site-name\">\n        <a href='http://shrinking-world.org/'>* Shrinking World Solutions *</a>\n      </h1>\n      <p style='color:yellow;margin-left:50px'>\n         Tips to help you thrive in the modern world\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div style='float:right'>\n      <form action=\"subscribe\" method=\"post\">\n        <div>\n          <div>Sign up for email updates</div>\n          <p><input id=\"id_email\" type=\"text\" name=\"email\" maxlength=\"100\" />\n          <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Update me\" /></p>\n        </div>\n      </form>\n    </div>\n\n            </div>\n            \n            \n            \n        </div>\n        <!-- END Header -->\n        \n\n        \n\n        <!-- Content -->\n        <div id=\"content\" class=\"colM\">\n            \n    <!--\n      -->\n    <div>\n          \n        <h1> Thinking </h1> \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              How you think dictates to a large extent the quality of your life.  Some people are naturally good \n         \n              at think through problems and coming up with great solutions.  Here are a few patterns that can help \n         \n              you in thinking better. \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              <b>List limit of 9 items</b> \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              Psychological studies have shown that people can only retain up to nine \n         \n              items in short-term memory.  This means that any list where you expect a selection ony works up to \n         \n              nine items.  Longer lists should be broken into multiple selection lists.  A reasonable list should \n         \n              have five or more items to be useful.  Nesting can be used to handle more complicated scenarios. \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              <b>Minimize mindshare</b> \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              Some things we can control and other things we cannot.  Try to make your \n         \n              circle of influence match your circle of concern.  Decrease the amount of mental energy that you \n         \n              invest in areas where you have little influence.  Save your energy for the things that you can \n         \n              change. \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              <b>Eliminate multitasking</b> \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              Your worst enemy is multiple tasks interrupting each other. Focus on one \n         \n              activity as much as possible until it is completed.  Then go on to the next with equal focus.  It \n         \n              is very easy for us to spend as much as 50% of our overall time just switching between multiple \n         \n              tasks.  This has become especially bad in our modern world.  Most people underestimate the cost of \n         \n              multitasking. \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              <b>Scheduled thinking</b> \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              Consider having a block of time scheduled to think through problems. \n         \n              Imagine knowing that you could just file that issue away for 3:00 Thursday.  I recommend that you \n         \n              perform this think time in a location where you cannot be interrupted.  Start with one hour per \n         \n              week.  You are likely to find that you need more time, and that it is easily justified by the \n         \n              return that you get. \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              <b>Think before you leap</b> \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              When confronted with a big decision consider taking both paths.  Imagine \n         \n              trying to live with each of the alternatives.  Which one seems to carry the least risk?  Which is \n         \n              better in the short term or in the long term?  What problem might surface?  What does your \n         \n              intuition tell you? \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              <b>Brainstorm/organize</b> \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              A great way to work out problems is to brainstorm.  This typically involves \n         \n              making a list of various ideas or impression.  During a brainstorm try to postpone judgment.  Once \n         \n              you have captured a bunch of ideas you can work on grouping things together.  This is the time to \n         \n              apply some judgment and pruning. \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              <b>Four by four analysis</b> \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              In order to think through, a topic try this technique. Break your main \n         \n              topic into four roughly equal topics.  Then decompose each of them into four more topics.  I found \n         \n              that this technique is remarkably useful to help me see the interesting aspects of almost any \n         \n              subject. It gives you twenty one statements that have both breadth and depth that can be explored later. \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              <b>Work on only one thing</b> \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              Select a single task that will be the most satisfying to have done. \n         \n              Postpone distractions until this task is complete. By selecting this task you are saying that this \n         \n              is the most important thing that you could do right now.  If you feel that a legitimate \n         \n              interruption is likely then limit the scope of your task to complete it sooner. Then you can focus \n         \n              on another task when needed. \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              <b>Use tools that preserve context</b> \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              Don't have multiple windows up on your computer (each vying for \n         \n              your attention). When you run an application, make the window take the full screen. Finish one \n         \n              thought before going on the next.  Turn off email notification, and check it between tasks.  If you \n         \n              don't control your tools they will control you.  Know what you must do in your job to succeed and \n         \n              create the environment that lets you focus.  If your job calls for 10 second response time on IM, \n         \n              then play along.  If it is a constant distraction, turn it off. \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              <b>Try new things</b> \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              Break \n         \n              your routine occassionally.  Keep a list of random things to do for fun. \n         \n              At least once a week, pick a fun thing and do it.  Life is too serious for most of us. Look up an \n         \n              old friend.  Do a random act of kindness.  Play a practical joke.  Tell someone that you love them. \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              <b>Random item from the past</b> \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              Imagine having a list of things to think about someday.  Now image \n         \n              doing a random selection from that list.  This would give you a miscellaneous topic to ponder for a \n         \n              few minutes.  I use this technique for a number of different lists.  I frequently get emails of \n         \n              ticklers to remind me of things that I originally thought about earlier.  The key idea here is to \n         \n              have a list of topics and a random selection.  You could do the same thing by shuffling 3 x 5 cards \n         \n              with ideas. \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              <b>Say in fewer words</b> \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              I \n         \n              like to make complex subjects simple.

Is it possible to get the \n         \n              same idea in 5 words?

This topic will show you how to accomplish this step-by-step.\n\nReduce the pain of setting up a new computer.  By following this process you can configure a new\ncomputer system in about 2 hours.  This may be just the incentive that you need to try out a Linux\noperating system.  Quick cloning of computer environments is very easy in Linux compared to other\navailable operating systems.\n\nWe all know the pain of setting up a new computer system.  Even though people that work with\ncomputers all of the time have set up many computer systems in the past.\n\nI regularly used about 7 different operating environments.  These differ by location, mobility,\nownership, and purpose.  I now have a recipe that allows a new computer environment to start doing\nuseful work in less than an hour.  Linux lends itself to this type of quick start.\n\nI still find that setting up Windows systems is extremely time intensive.  First, Ubuntu is\ninstalled off of the Live CD.  This operation takes about 20 minutes with about 5 minutes of setup\ntime and a break to watch a half-hour TV show.  When you return you are ready to customize the\nenvironment.\n\nI have special commands that I am constantly updating.  Currently I have about 150 commands that\nautomate everything that I do with the computer.\n\nThese commands are all stored in a directory called bin in my home directory.  They can be moved by\nnetwork or thumb drive to any new system.  Next I link my script to customize the shell from my home\ndirectory using:\n\n\tln ~/bin/bashrc ~/.bashrc\n\nNow you can make this active.\n\n\t. ~/.bashrc\n\nThis process lets you get up and running in well less than an hour with a computer environment that\nhas all of your favorite automation tools already configured.

These are my non-negotiables in life.\n\n**Know God**\nI want to fully embrace God's truth, freedom, love, and purpose for my life.   If I miss this then\nnothing else matters.  Over the years I have watched so many people that I love lose their way.  Not\neveryone finishes well, but I want to be one of them.\n\n**Influence others**\nI want to influence others by sharing life-changing ideas. The thought of being ineffective or\ninsignificant drives me to excellence. I measure my legacy by the impact I have on others.\n\n**Successful kids** \nMany areas of life that must all work together for us to be happy and content.  I wish for each of\nmy children to experience well-being physically, emotionally, spiritually, socially, and mentally.\nThe possibility that they would be defeated and destroyed in any of these areas is a constant point\nof discussion with God.\n\n**Relationships**\nI want to belong and be accepted by the people closest to me. I am not content with shallow or\nsuperficial relationships.  I fear that those who know me most will not like me when they truly know\nwho I am.  This makes it hard for me to be vulnerable to others.\n\n**Security**\nI want to be healthy and financially secure.  I fear that some tragedy will destroy everything and\nthat I will lose it all suddenly.\n\nSee also [[Prayer]], KnowingGod, InfluenceOthers, SuccessfulKids, [[Relationships]], [[Security]]\n", "user": 3, "title": "Dreams And Fears"}}, {"pk": 1023, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/HearingTheBible", "time": "2014-06-15T20:39:29.514", "text": "* Hearing The Bible *                 -*-muse-*-\n\nFamiliar words can lose their impact.\n\nAfter years of reading and hearing the bible, it stops having the impact it once did.\n- Read without benefit\n- No surprises left\n- God is full of surprises\n- The dynamice voice of the Spirit\n\nI have started a practice that brings fresh hearing to my bible reading.\n- Select a small passage\n- Say it in my own words, preserving the meaning\n- Change the voice, as if Jesus was speaking to me\n- Consistent with sound bible interpretation\n\nPersonal receptivity\n- Different level of participation (mind/emotions)\n- Personal nature of the message\n- Ongoing and repeated benefit in my quiet times\n- Systematic prayer guide\n\nLessons learned\n- Start small but build\n- Regular pattern (twice a week)\n- Dynamic conversation with God\n- Invite him into our pain\n\nSee also PrayerPractices\n\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Hearing The Bible"}}, {"pk": 1024, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/EmacsKeyBindings", "time": "2014-06-15T20:39:29.722", "text": "* Emacs Key Bindings *                 -*-muse-*-\n\n**Desired keys**\n * F5          Refresh (dired g)\n * F5          Visit same file\n * Return to insert Return\n * C-Return to go to link\n\n\n**Moving around**\n * C-Home      Start of buffer\n * C-End       End of buffer\n * M-j         Jump to line\n * C-y         Muse -

This is a description of what happened\nand actions we are taking to repair the situation and prevent future disruptions.\n\n\nWhat happened?\n\nThe old mill server ran out of disk space on its main volume.  This caused the system to\nmalfunction.   It stopped working completely at 9:30 PM on Sunday, 3-10.   It may have had problems\nprior to that.\n\nRunning out of space creates a variety of mystery problems, since some operations will succeed and\nothers will fail.\n\nAll data traffic from the watermills goes through the old mill server.  All traffic was blocked\nstarted and 9:30 PM, Sunday.\n\nAll data from the watermills was deposited into the local storages in the home directory for the\nWatermill user.  This is not on the same volume that ran out of space.\n\nThe command that sends data to the production server was blocked causing the data traffic to be\nblocked.\n\n\nHow we found the issue\n\nThe automatic tests reported massive failures from the blocked traffic.  Testing on the production\nserver confirmed that everything there was functioning properly.\n\nThe inbox on the old mill server contained several hundred files that were blocked.\n\nThe inbox script was running, but the files were not being processed.  The forwarding command was\nrunning properly but the import command would hang when executed manually.\n\nRestarting the process did not fix the issue.  Showing the available disk space on all volumes\nrevealed that the root volume was completely out of space.\n\nInvestigation reveals that a large amount of space was used by the Git repos.  The largest repo is\ntied to the old mill server.  This repo grows nightly and was responsible for the problem.\n\n\nWhat repair actions were taken?\n\nTo fix the immedate problem, I removed some old repos that are no longer needed.  This freed up 12\nGB immediately.\n\nThen with the system running properly.  I pushed all alert files through the system.  There were 84\nfiles to be processed.  I confirmed that these went all the way through the system.\n\nThe accounting files were also processed by reimporting them into the inbox.  This resulted in all\nof the accounting being brought up to date.  There were 124 files for accounting.  Mannually trigger\nthe export of the accounting data to Wex Net.\n\nNext, all of the log files were imported.  We had 363 files for tank, vends, and pressure.\n\nTesting of the system will continue throughout the day on Monday.\n\n\nHow can we prevent this in the future?\n\nThe root cause of the problem is the growth rate of the server git repo.  This has already been\naddressed for the new server repo.  This was fixed for the new repo in January.  There is also a\ntest in place for disk usage on the new server.\n\nA new test will be added for the disk space on the old server.  We will also make some changes for\nthe growth rate of the repo itself.\n\n\nSummary\n\nThe loss of disk space resulted in a temporary outage of the watermill server.  The problem has now\nbeen resolved with no data loss.  Additional testing and fixes will be setup to defend against this\ntype of problem and minimize the impact in the future.\n\nPlease report any additional problems you may see.\n\n\n", "user": 3,

Clara, California.  This is the first time\nthat I have been able to attend Pycon.  It is very exciting to be interacting with so many fantastic\npeople.\n\n**Pyramid Tutorial**\n\nI attended a four-hour tutorial on Pyramid, which is a Python framework, with the goal of building\nsmall web applications quickly that can scale into complex applications.  Many frameworks are good\nat either but not both.\n\nDuring the tutorial we installed all of the tools, learned about the technology, and built a simple\nweb application.  I can now use this to build other apps.\n\n**Effective Django**\n\nThis tutorial assumed the ability to build simple applications.   It dealt with all of the issues\nthat porfessional developers need to build apps successfully.\n\nIt gave a set of best practices, many of which I was already using, but several I was not.   The key\ninsights that were gained, included use of Selenium for testing of the UI, and Class Based Views\nthat allow for greater code resue in the UI front-end.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\n**pycon - day 2**\n\n**Test-Driven Django**\n\nThis tutorial covered the tools and techniques for doing test driven development with a Django\napplication.  It covered both how to do effective unit testing and functional testing.  We set up\nSelenium to both control and test the page elements that the web browser will see.  I will be using\nall of these techniques on all current and future projects.\n\n**Heroku**\n\nHeroku is a web deployment platform that takes all of the pain out of deployment.  It is a PaaS\n(platform as a service).  During this workshop we learned about the 12 factors that affect web\ndeployment (http://12factor.net).  \n\nWe then built and deployed a web application using the following recipe\n(http://pycon-tutorial.herokuapp.com).  This process can be repeated in less than five minutes.\nHeroku provides a free service that can support a hobby job, but also scales to extremely large\nsystems.  It is not the cheapest service (considering only fees), but probably the cheapest (if you\nvalue your time). This is going to be my main deployment engine moving forward.\n\n**Wiring Django Packages**\n\nThis session dealt with all of the issues of package usage, installation, deployment, and creation.\nI missed most of this session due to the Heroku session.  The notes are at http://bit.ly/WDP2013\n\n**Tools**\n\nGetting working installations of virtualenv, selenium, and heroku was worth the cost of the entire\nconference.  I can go home now...\n\n... but wait there's more.\n \n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\n**pycon - day 3**\n\nThe first two days were tutorial sessions.  The regular conference sessions spanned the next three\ndays.  The conference attendance what 2500 and the largest that the organizers want it to be.  This\nis to have the maximum opportunity to foster the community spirit of \"people helping people\".\n\n**Raspberry Pi**\n\nEben Upton spoke from Cambridge about the need to foster a hacker ethic.  Cambridge has seen a\nconstant erosion in the number of qualified applications to the computer science program.  Eben was\ngiven the task of revitalizing interest in working with computers by producing low-cost hardware\nthat invites students to program.  Today's systems are built for users and discourage programming.\nTheir solution was the Rasperry Pi, a $35 computer board that has enough capability for almost any\nhobbiest project.  The response to the product has exceeded everyone's expectations.  We were all\ngiven a Raspberry Pi and told to build something cool.\n\nThere was also a lot of discussion about ways to work in communities and schools to foster interest\nin computers and programming.  I am very interested in this subject and would like to work with\nothers on doing something in our community.\n\n**Naming of Ducks**\n\nThis talk dealt with the best pracitices for naming functions, classes, and variables within Python\nprograms.  This is even more important in a language that does not enforce the variable types to be\ndesignated as a they are used.\n\n**Exceptions**\n\nBruce Eckel gave a talk on best practices with exception handling in Python.  He discussed how\nexceptions in Python differ for other lanugages like Java and C++.\n\n**Kivy**\n\nKivy is a GUI toolkit that is great for mobile applications.  It supports non-traditional input\ndevices like multi-touch and Leap Motion.  Visit Kivy.org to learn more about using the toolkit for\nyour apps.\n\n**Python 3.3**\n\nWhy do you want to upgrade from 2.7 to 3.3?  There are many small features that can save effort.\nI'm looking at switching my work to Python 3.3.   Now with virtualenv in place it should be fairly\neasy to move forward.\n\n**Five minute to deploy (using PaaS)**\n\nThis talk discussed the different services available for hosting web apps.  It made the argument\nthat for most small shops (without a large IT staff), you need to get the highest possible value\nfrom your service provider.  He then gave a comparison of six different PaaS (Platform as a service)\nproviders. We gave a demo of a deployment on Heroku that took five minutes.\n\n\n\nSee also PyCon,  [[~/pycon/]], BizPortal\n", "user": 3, "title": "Py Con Learn"}}, {"pk": 1103, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/OtherMarketing", "time": "2014-06-15T20:39:46.179", "text": "Other Marketing                  -*-muse-*-\n    Business networking\n        PeopleTemplate\n        FollowUp      \n        BusinessContacts\n        NetworkingAssumptions\n        TrustLevels          \n        BusinessPartners     \n        TacticalPartnerships \n        MarketingPlan        \n        [[Networking]]\n        StrategicInterviewing\n        TrustRamp\n        BusinessStrategy     \n    Job Markets\n        BusinessSuccess\n        BusinessOpportunities\n        BusinessRoles\n        CareerAsTrainer\n        FiftyTricksProject\n        BusinessExperiments\n        BusinessAction\n        BusinessStakeholders\n", "user": 3, "title": "Other Marketing"}}, {"pk": 1104, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/PerformanceEvaluation", "time": "2014-06-15T20:39:46.384", "text": "* Performance Evaluation *                 -*-muse-*-\n\n**Technical Competence**\n    current knowledge\n    learning abilty\n    \n    * Very quick time to contribution (python vend count, alerts, archive)\n\n**Judgement**\n    how you make decisions\n    prioritization\n\n    * No support disasters, able to supply changes needed for var update\n\n**Teamwork**\n    communication skills\n    cooperative attitude\n\n    * Great attitude; good communication; willing to serve\n\n**Productivity**\n    results for effort expended\n    tools and techniques\n\n    * Each task is completed quicker than expected, resulting in greater expectations\n\n**Dependability**\n    works independently\n    gets things done\n\n    * most things get done without reminders\n\n**Leadership**\n    manages self\n    influences others\n\n    * Build relationships with Dean, Eric, Mark\n\n\n**Working Relationship**\n    learning opportunities, growth\n    pay\n    hours\n    projects\n    communication\n    work environment\n    unmet needs\n\nSee also [[Business]]\n\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Performance Evaluation"}}, {"pk": 1105, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/WmStartDevelopment", "time": "2014-06-15T20:39:46.642", "text": "* Watermill Start Development *                 -*-muse-*-\n\n*Set up the development tools every day the same*\n\nRequires ten minutes\n\n**Record past activity**\n[[Done]]    - record time and results [[Mileage]]\n[[Work]] - select the starting task for the stack\n\n**Open windows**\nMain terminal\nBuild window\nFred test system\nWatermill test system\nEditor\nSupport Center\nEmail\n\n**Get current code**\ncd $c\ngk\nselect development env and code branch\n\n**Build and test**\nbuild the starting code\ntest on watermill (verify that mill is operational)\nrun all unit tests (pull, test-start)\nfix anything that fails\n\n**Integration**\nwhen local changes are good, then integrate\npull, build, test, push\n\n**Enter the development loop**\nstart with the biggest test\non each failure decrease the testing scope\non each success increase the testing scope\nset 25 minute timer for each iteration\neach iteration ends with a commit\neach commit must be tested\n\nSee also [[Brain]], DevelopmentRules, RapidDevelopment\n\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Watermill Start Development"}}, {"pk": 1106, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/StacieNeeds", "time": "2014-06-15T20:39:46.902", "text": "* Stacie Needs *                 -*-muse-*-\n\n*What Stacie needs from her lover*\n\nThese are the things that are her top emotional needs.

others.  What if we\ncould have a authentic experience with God that would last the rest of our lives?  What if by\nknowing God we could become more loving and at peace with ourselves and others?  This is the journey\nof seeking out pragmatic spirituality.\n\n________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n* 1. Peace with God\n\nLife is really pretty pointless until we can find a power beyond ourselves.  We can pursue many\nthings to try to fulfill our deepest desires.  But apart from having a relationship with God,\nnothing will ever satisfy us. Yielding control of our lives to God is an essential aspect of a rich\nlife. \n\nWe humans have an amazing capacity for self-deception.  We see things through a very distorted\nlens.  We believe things because we want to, not because they are true.  At some point in our lives\nwe must embrace absolute truth.  This is a simple acknowledgment of reality, rather than bending\nthe truth to match how we think it should be.\n\nOne of the most fascinating things about the good news of reconciliation, is that when we admit the\ntruth about ourselves we gain God's acceptance. When we acknowledge how hopeless life without God\nis, we receive his hope. With the understanding of our weakness we begin to rely on his\nstrength. This begins a phenomenal process of transformation.\n\nWe receive the provisions of the Lord as a gift.  As we understand this we can stop trying so hard\nto earn God's love. Nothing that we can do or be, is that great anyway.  We gain his favor by seeking\nrelationship with him, not by trying to do favors for him.  This changes the nature of every facet\nof our lives.\n\nWhen we spend time alone with God we find true peace.  Opening ourselves to his presence is the\nonly way to truly be at peace.  This does not occur automatically.  It happens when we consciously\nlay down our own plans and demands, and simply receive his love.  This can be a hard thing for us\nsince we live such busy lives.  But is is well worth the effort.\n\n________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n* 2. Learning to love\n\nIt is impossible to be happy and content unless we are able to receive love.  We learn from the Lord\nhow to receive love.  He desires to demonstrate his love for us in so many varied ways.  He can be\nincredibly extravagant with his love.\n\nThis experience of taking in God's love changes us.  We are then able to receive love from others.\nWe understand that the Lord has put others in our life to be a blessing.  We experience\ncompanionship, comfort, and Ecstasy in our relationships with others.\n\nAs God changes our hearts we are able to begin to love those around us. We discover that we can\nextend more mercy to family members, friends, and coworkers.  People don't seem quite as irritating\nas they once did.  This is a supernatural work.  Receiving love and mercy allows us to be more\nmerciful with other.\n\nCutting off that flow of love has the opposite effect.  We all know plenty of religious people who\nare harsh and critical.  It is possible to not know God's love and be very religious.  In fact,\npeople who know God well are not at all religious.  Religion is about keeping rules.  It has nothing\nto do with a real experience of God's love.\n\nThis process of learning to love can become so out of control that we begin to love people we don't\neven know.  We hear about people that are suffering and want to figure out a way to do something to\nhelp. Being motivated by love is completely different that feeling guilt.\n\nWe can have such a relationship with the Lord that we look for opportunities to serve others.  The\ndesire to protect the helpless is a direct result of knowing the God helped us when we were\nhelpless. The willingness to lay down our arms comes from knowing how God brought peace into our\nlives when we were his enemies.\n\n________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n* 3. Making a difference\n\nEverybody has a set of special abilities, personality, and life experiences.  These are not simply\nan accident of chance.  Your special blend was built by God for a purpose. Think of it as a\nsuper-power.  God has given you gifts and talents that he intends to use in some unique way.\n\nUnfortunately, many people go through their entire life within discovering God's unique plans.\nFinding your purpose in life is one of the greatest thrills there is.  Don't let the constant\ndemands of survival prevent you from knowing what special things that God has in store for you.\n\nAt the end of your life, the most important things you have done will be about relationships.\nInvest in the lives of others.  Start with your spouse, kids, parents, and friends.  But let is go\nbeyond that.  Live in such a way that you are a better friend to everyone that you meet than they\nare to you.\n\nLearn to forgive.  Let go of the disappointment of life.  You are guaranteed that others will let you\ndown. Don't collect those hurts as if they are some kind of treasure. They are more like frozen\nrattlers.  Leave them alone or you will feel the bite.  \n\nBe intentional about working with others.  Find as much common ground as you can. Gather partners\nwherever you go.  These come in many forms: coworkers, business partners, comrades, spouses,\ncompanions, and confidants.  Seek ways to minimize disagreement and maximize the amount of\ncooperation. \n\n________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n* 4. Accepting reality\n\nCourage and peace are two keep ingredients in a successful life.  You need boldness to make the\nchanges that must be made.  But you also need the grace to accept reality for what it is.  If you\nlack courage you will live the life of a victim; but lacking peace will lead you to be a victimizer.\n\nBefore all else fails pray.  The quality of our prayer life is one of the truest measures of\nspiritual maturity.  We can fake a lot of actions for others.  How we respond to the presence of God\nin our lives is an indicator of our true mental and spiritual health.  This includes times when he\npoints out things that we would rather not see.\n\nLearn God's strategy for you.  Because he has created each person to be completely unique, he has a\nvery special plan for you.  It is not the same as what he has for anyone else.  Finding the specific\nopportunities that are right for you is one of the great mysteries of live.  It will bring you great\njoy and tremendous satisfaction.  When you are doing what you are made for you will be the most\nsuccessful and happiest person that you could possibly be.\n\nGive it all to the Lord. He provide you with everything that you need.  Surrendering everything will\nbring you a tremendous amount of peace.  You will not feel the constant desire to control, protect,\nand hoard.  Be generous with all that you have.   And not just your possessions.  Be generous with\nyour praise, your time, and mercy for others.  Live with an open hand.\n\nBe open to new opportunities.  The greatest things in your life you will not see coming.  Receive\nthem as the gifts that they are.  Live a life of constant thankfulness and gratitude.\n\n________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n* 5.

Think of it as an erector set that can be used to assemble cool things.  Linus did a very\ncool thing by making this open to the masses.\n\nThe beginning of your automation framework is a single command.  This command is the command you\nwill use to build every other command you need.  It is like asking the Genie for a thousand wishes\nas your first wish.\n\nCreate a command called 'cmd-new'.  Put the follow content in it.\n\n    #!/bin/bash\n    # Create a new command\n    \n    name=$b/$1\n    cat <<EOF  > $name\n    #!/bin/bash\n    # $2\n    echo $2\n    EOF\n    \n    chmod 755 $name\n    e $name\n\nEach time you run this command it will create a new command with name matching the first argument.\nIt assumes that '$b' points to the directory with your commands.\n\nThis script sets the new command to be executable.  Then it runs your text editor on the file.\n\ncmd-new will let you create any new command with about 5 seconds of overhead.  Think about why this\nis important.\n\nIn the world of programming, abstraction is everything.  It lets you elevate your thinking.  You go\nfrom thinking about how to do something to thinking about the result you want.\n\nLet me illustrate with a simple result.  Type 'cd;du|sort -nr|head' in a terminal.  See what it\ndoes? It finds the ten biggest hogs in your home directory.\n\nNow put that in a command with \n\n    $ cmd-new showhogs \"# Show disk hogs\"\n\nNow look at the detailed implementation of the command.  It is very terse.  There is not much typing\nsaved.  But there is a lot of thinking saved.  Identify the concepts that are used here.\n\n    * Go to home directory\n    * Find disk space by visiting recursive directories\n    * Use the current directory as a starting point\n    * List each directory with a number k-bytes and the directory name\n    * Sort this list\n    * Use a numeric sort so that 10 > 2\n    * Put the big numbers first\n    * Only show the first ten\n    * List them so I can chain the result\n\nOnce this scenario is fully contructed and tested you can immediately forget the details.  Don't try\nto remember stuff like this.  Only think about the result that you wish to achieve.  \n\nLater when you need to resuse these tricks, you refer to the script to recall how it was done.  Your\nscripts act as your memory.\n\n\nSee also DaysOfLinux\n\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Create Command"}}, {"pk": 1130, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/Write", "time": "2014-06-15T20:39:52.431", "text": "* Write *                 -*-muse-*-\n\n\n\n\nSee also  SeamansLog SpiritualLog TheCity [[Teach]] ", "user": 3, "title": "Write"}}, {"pk": 1131, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/AddressedToGod", "time": "2014-06-15T20:39:52.767", "text": "* Addressed To God *                 -*-muse-*-\n\nThis journal is written as a prayer to You.

The pain\nends with the surrender of each area. But the freedom lasts forever,\nor at least until I reclaim the lost ground.\n\nYielding to God's will brings a peace of knowing that he is in\ncomplete control.  It brings rest and healing.

Make sure that diagnostics and engineer tools are deployed.  Sync files with contents of\nserver.\n\n2. Build new code and deploy on ethan.  Use 'set-power-on' script to configure the autoload. \n\n3. Setup cron to 'save-data' every five minutes. Confirm that cron starts up automatically.  Confirm\nthat file updates are saved.\n\n4. Use python script to configure a known accounting file.\n\n5. Confirm automatic save.\n\n6. Setup reload to 'recall-data'. Confirm that accounting is saved.\n\n7. Add 'on-shutdown' hook to run a script before the 'load' replaces the software.\n\n8. Fold all changes into initial flash card image.\n\n9.

This reduces the overall risk to the client by allowing the project to meet the minimum\nfunctionality and then stop. Most project have a large amount of unknown factors that make it very\ndifficult to set scope at the beginning.\n\nA project can produce a steady stream of results to the client.  This will allow you to set the\nagenda for what gets developed next, and make any necessary changes.  You can guide the project\nthroughout rather than commit to all of the features upfront.\n\nShrinking World Solutions recommends this form of pricing for most projects.  It is the most\nflexible way to produce the quickest and cheapest result.  Hourly rates are established by the skill\nlevel of the person doing the task (typically between $50 - $135).\n\n\n**Fixed Pricing**\n\nThis model can work well for projects that are fully understood at the outset.  This is often the\ncase when replacing an existing system with new technology.  Under this model each piece of\nfunctionality is built into the price.  A price list is used to set the price of the overall\nproject.\n\nFollowing is a sample price list.  This is used for illustration only since the details for each\nproject vary greatly.\n\n * Gathering requirements & design work  (these both scale with the project and are priced into the\n   other parts of the model)\n * Testing is built in to the development time\n * Final acceptance testing is done by the client\n * Setup web hosting and deployment (typical web hosting is inexpensive)\n\n * Data types (eg. customers, order, part numbers)          $1000/type\n * Web views (eg. add customer, list orders)                $500/view\n * Data import/export formats (eg. send/receive orders)     $1000/file type\n * Security (eg. customer logins, SSL, SSH)                 $1000/feature\n\n\n\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Pricing Web Development"}}, {"pk": 1204, "model": "doc.doc", "fields":

For example, to compute some primes:\n\n        >>> filter(lambda x: x%2 != 0 and x%3 != 0, range(2, 25))\n        [5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23]\n        >>>\n\n**Map**\n\nmap(function, sequence) calls function(item) for each of the\nsequence's items and returns a list of the return values. For example,\nto compute some cubes:\n\n        >>> map(lambda x: x*x*x, range(1, 11))\n        [1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343, 512, 729, 1000]\n        >>>\n\nMore than one sequence may be passed; the function must then have as\nmany arguments as there are sequences and is called with the\ncorresponding item from each sequence (or None if some sequence is\nshorter than another). If None is passed for the function, a function\nreturning its argument(s) is substituted.\n\nCombining these two special cases, we see that map(None, list1, list2)\nis a convenient way of turning a pair of lists into a list of\npairs. For example:\n\n        >>> seq = range(8)\n        >>> map(None, seq, map(lambda x: x*x, seq))\n        [(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 4), (3, 9), (4, 16), (5, 25), (6, 36), (7, 49)]\n        >>>\n\n\n**Reduce**\n\nreduce(function, sequence) returns a single value constructed by\ncalling the (binary) function on the first two items of the sequence,\nthen on the result and the next item, and so on.

In this\ncase the starting value is returned for an empty sequence, and the\nfunction is first applied to the starting value and the first sequence\nitem, then to the result and the next item, and so on.

This often happens when we are going along\nand minding our own business, which is really another way of saying ignoring God. Then we suddenly\nbecome aware of how the Lord has been working in our lives.\n\nThis can be a dramatic experience, like Paul going to Damascus, or a more subtle one, such as John\nWesley feeling \"strangely warmed\".  Either way this is a powerful emotional experience for us.  This\nbecome a reference point, as we think about our relationship with God.\n\nWe are not always aware of his presence in our lives. The problem is on our side not his.  Life is\nfilled with turmoil, business, relationships, losses and triumphs.  We are often led by fear and\npride. Both make us feel alienated from God.\n\nThen, often in the midst of confusion, God shows up.  We suddenly see everything differently.  He\nshow us how one core assumption is invalid and we spend months trying to understand the full\nimplications of that.\n\nIn the bible, people would often build memorials to commemorate these events.  This is a good idea\nfor us too.  Place something in your daily life that symbolizes the emotional significance of an\nencounter with God.\n\nThe specific experience that you have at a turning point will not last.  But there is an residual\neffect that leaves us changed. Later in the business of life, we still recall the moment when we\ncaught a glimpse of the glory of God.\n\nGrab a hold of these moments and savor them.  Create reminders that will take you back to that time\nwhen you felt the Lord's presence the most.  He is longing for us to feel closer to him.  Use that\nmemory to create more time seeking his closeness.\n\nIn the presence of God, every daily struggle seems less critical.  This lesson is the most important\nthing that we learn in the turning point.\n\nSee also PrayerPractices\n\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Turning Point"}}, {"pk": 1226, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/NineThings", "time": "2014-06-15T20:40:15.189", "text": "* Nine Things *                 -*-muse-*-\n\n9 Things you must do -  Henry Cloud\n\n1.

The missions conference was the start of a\ntime of rapid spiritual growth.  I started to realize the importance of setting aside time to be\nalone with God.  From December to April I began creating regular habits of daily, weekly, and\nquarterly quiet times.\n\nBut recently, this time has tapered off.  I have become preoccupied with the concerns of my life and\nless focused on the concerns of the kingdom of God.  I really want to recapture this habit and want\nto seek God every week.  I need the Spirit speaking to me on a regular basis.\n\nHere is what I would like to commit to:\n * Daily quiet time of 30 minutes\n * Weekly quiet time of 2 hours\n * Quarterly quiet time of 12 hours\n\nDuring this time one of the challenges that I have is to focus on the Spirit of God and his work in\nme.  Many other ideas, concerns, and agendas seem to creep in and take over.  I need to build a\ncertain amount of structure to support the focus on what God is wanting to do.\n\nSee also PrayerPractices\n\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Personal Log"}}, {"pk": 1239, "model":

been working on restructuring my business to better serve my\nclients.  I have been seeking to turn Shrinking World Solutions into a team of consultants that can\ndeliver high-quality software systems at reasonable cost.\n\nIn the past all of the work billed by the company was for my personal work.  While I intend to work\nin the business full-time and be involved in the daily engineering work, this has real limitations\non the number of engineering hours I can deliver to each client.  The cost is also much higher than\nit should be for the results achieved.\n\nMy goal is to hire, train, deploy, and manage the work of a team of specialists. This will allow us\nto deliver both deeper and broader solutions to our clients.  I plan to be specifying, designing,\nand reviewing the work, while having some others do some of the detailed programming.  \n\nMy son, Josiah, is currently working on a doctorate in bioinformatics at CU.  He wrote an\napplication to view the genome.  I have been collaborating with Josiah and his friend, Bryan Hurst, on\nthis project for about a year.  I am considering hiring Bryan as an associate progammer in my\ncompany.  I met with him today to discuss this and he is open to the idea.\n\nWatermill has need of more programming effort that I can currently afford to provide to finish out\nthe server projects.  There are currently twelve projects underway that are making very slow\nprogress.  This could be a solution help expedite these projects without letting the cost baloon.\n\nCurrently I can provide about 4 hours of engineering and 4 hours of support each week.  This is\nbarely about to keep up with the burden of things that break and unable to expand the current\nsystem. If I were to use 20 hours/week of Bryan's time, I could produce, about 4 hours of support\neach week, and 24 hours of engineering.\n\nI would be responsible for the quality and productivity of all work done for Watermill by Shrinking\nWorld Solutions.  Both training and management would be administered personally by me in\ncollaboration with Bryan.  Initially, he would work out of my office in Windsor, until the need for\ncommunication dimished.\n\nBecause the hourly rate for Bryan would be less than half of what I make, the cost per hour to\nWatermill would be significantly reduced.  I hope that this will be a long term collaboration and\nintend on helping Bryan to develop a career as a leader in software development.  I also hope to use\nthis as a model that would allow other people to be added as needed to my company.\n\nIn order to move forward on this, I need your approval to enlist his help on Watermill projects.  I\nbelieve that I will need to bill out his time at $35/hour in order to create enough incentive to get\nhim involved for the long-term.\n\nIf we are able to move quickly then Bryan can be fully engaged and cover any issues that appear\nwhile I am gone to Jordan.  He has agreed to make this a priority and to commit up to 20 hours\nweekly to this project.\n\nPlease let me know what you think about this proposal.\n\n\nSee also [[Business]]\n", "user": 3, "title": "Watermill Subcontracting"}}, {"pk": 1244, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/Deployment", "time": "2014-06-15T20:40:19.459", "text": "* Deployment *                 -*-muse-*-\n\n**Deploment of Web Servers**\nSmall numbers of components are managed with ssh\nBut as things grow you need automation\nArbitrary languages, platforms\nFast deployment and rollback\nComplete packages\nUniform mechanism\n\n**Galaxy**\nPackager for application deployment\nThere is one tar ball with a bin directory for control scripts\nDwarf -

But it is also a personal letter\ndelivered by the Holy Spirit to me in December 2011.  The words are different but the message is\ntrue to the original.\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nDear Mark,\n\nWhen I think of you I feel real joy.  I started the work in you and will finish it.  My presence and\nprovision is with you, even in suffering and pain.\n\nI want for your life to overflow with love.  I desire for you to keep growing in knowledge and\nunderstanding.  You need to understand what really matters in order to live in purity, waiting for\nme.\n\nI saved you initially and will produce my character in you.  This process glorifies me and is what I\nintended from the start.\n\nYou can be confident that both your life and death will bring me honor. You live for me, but dying\nis an even better deal for you.\n\nYour life is about helping others grow to understand the joy of trusting me.  My presence in your\nlife will give you even more confidence in me.\n\nLiving like true citizens of my kingdom honors me.  Keep on living for what really matters, even\nwhen others are not there to encourage you.  I will restore everything, so don't be intimidated by\nanything. \n\nI have started a profound work in you.  I gave you hope and a sense of belonging.  My love brings\nyou peace and comfort and my Spirit brings you unity with other believers.  I have planted love and\ncompassion deep within you.\n\nContinue this unity by wholeheartedly agreeing with others, fully loving them, and working well\ntogether.  Don't be selfish or try to impress others.  Both of these are rooted in pride.  Be\nhumble, thinking of others as more important. Put the interests of others before your own.\n\nHave my attitude about others. I was willing to deny my own deity.  Instead I gave up my divine\nglory and became a human slave.  I was executed as a lowly and despised criminal.\n\nAs a result I now have the highest reputation possible.  I am the rightful object of worship for\neverything living on earth and beyond.  I am absolute Lord of all creation.  All glory everywhere\nbelongs to me.\n\nYou should reflect this glory in your daily life.  You have started well, but continue on with\nobedience and passion for me.  For I am working in you, giving you both the desire and power to do\nwhat pleases me.\n\nDo everything without complaining or arguing, to silence your critics.  Become a peacemaker with\nchild-like innocence. Shine like lights in a dark, nasty, and corrupt world.  \n\nCling to my promises.  Then you will finish well and my full work will be accomplished in you.\n\nYour life may end up being a simple act of sacrifice to me. But worship is ultimately an end in\nitself.  Every act of worship brings glory that I deserve.\n\nShare in the joy of authentic worship.  Don't miss out.  Joy is best when shared.\n\nI bring people into your life to encourage and strengthen you.  You will be surrounded by those who\ncare nothing for my leadership.  But there will always be a few, that are like moms and dads to you.\n\nSome people have demonstrated their quality through their constant acts of service and love.  You\nshould treasure these relationships and spend time with them.\n\nAs you follow me you, will grow closer to other believers. You will long for more opportunities to\nspend time together.  Your destinies will be joined together in both joy and sorrow. I am leading\nyou both, so all your relationships are a key part of my plan for your life.\n\nNo matter what happens, true joy is found in me.  I provide consistent instruction to keep you on\nthe right path.  Try to stay on my path, so that my plans can develop fully within you.\n\nBeware of evil people who wear religious masks.  My true followers have no confidence in human\neffort, even when you feel justified by your own accomplishments.  You have good reason to trust in\nyour own performance if anyone does.\n\nYou have led a successful, orderly, and law-abiding life.  You have raised a great family, been\nactive in the church, and truly pursued my purpose for your life.  You have sacrificed for those you\nlove and tried to be good your entire life.\n\nYou once thought these things were valuable, but now you see that they are worthless in view of my\nlove.  In fact, nothing holds its value next to the infinite value of knowing me.\n\nSo, for my sake, discard everything else like garbage.  Do this in order to become one with\nme. Don't depend on your own ability to be good or follow rules, but follow me with simple yet\nunwavering trust.\n\nYou become pure by trusting in me, nothing else. Long to know me and the power that brought me back\nfrom death.  Choose to suffer with me, so that you too can experience my dramatic resurrection power\nworking in you.\n\nYou have not already achieved these things or reached perfection. But keep pressing on toward the\nplace that I am taking you.  This is the ultimate destination that I have planned for you always.\n\nForget what is already behind you. Focus on the one thing that truly counts. Forget the past\nfailures and pain and look forward to what lies ahead. Press on to reach the end of the race.\nRemember the prize that is waiting at the finish line of this life, me and my kingdom fully in you.\n\nSee also [[Prayer]]\n", "user": 3, "title": "Letter From Jesus"}}, {"pk": 1275, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/JordanStories", "time": "2014-06-15T20:40:26.850", "text": "* Jordan Stories *                 -*-muse-*-\n\n**News is Distorted**\n\nThis is the first trip to the middle-east for Stacie and me. We are shocked by how little we truly\nunderstand of this region.  The history is very rich, which means that the various conflicts run\nvery deep.\n\nAfter just a few days it became clear that the news that we get in the US is very distorted.  It is\nalways filtered through a strong political agenda. Here, we are able to get a much fuller story from\nboth local residents and Americans that have lived here for decades.\n\nBeyond the politics, we are able to see what God is doing in this area of the world.  He is at work\nin many different ways.  I plan on writing a series of articles to relate experiences that we have\nhad, tell the stories of others, and show you how you can become involved in the work of God's\nkingdom.\n\nStacie and I are currently in Amman, Jordan.  We are meeting with so many wonderful people and want\nto tell their stories.  We hope that these stories prompt you to pray and feel a part of God's work\nhere.\n\n\n**Training Jordanian Pastors**\n\nOn Thursday and Friday a training event was held for Jordanian pastors.  These men are sharing the\ngospel and doing great work around the capital city of Amman.  Jordan has about 6.5 million people\nwith about half of them living in the greater Amman area.  70% of all people are under age 23, 35%\nunder 14.\n\nRick O. spoke about how God is moving in the youth.  This is a vital message for the church in\nAmman. Youth tend to be much more open to change than their parents.  People are actively looking\nfor answers to the difficulties of living life.\n\nA strategy for Rescuing, Reaching, Rooting, Releasing, and Resourcing youth may provide a model for\nhow to establish the church for the next generation.  The demographics of Jordan make this message\nan extremely important one.\n\nIt is an amazing experience to be a part of worship in another culture and language.  Even though we\ncannot understand most of what is spoken we recognize the exuberant praise and worship of our\ncommon savior. \n\n\n**Let's Buy That Mountain**\n\nSometimes our faith is too small and our vision of God's heart is too limited.  When we see others\ntrusting him, then it gives us courage to step out into deeper waters.  \n\nYesterday, I saw an example of faith in action.  We visited a church in Jordan that is really moving\nforward. The church appears to be made up of mostly people under 30. They have a heart for reaching\nout to their city and nation.\n\nThe pastor had a vision for creating a camp for youth and young adults.  He located a piece of\nproperty in the vicinity of Mt. Nebo (the spot where Moses died before the Jews entered the promised\nland).  It is also not far from the location where Jesus was baptized in the Jordan river.\n\nThere is a building and olive trees on the property.  The view is spectacular with mountains and\nsteep ravines immediately on the edge of the property.  We stood on the mountain and tried to\nimagine the giant throngs of people and livestock making there way through this spot down to the\nriver.\n\nIt is exciting to visualize how God will be using this spot to change the lives of so many people.\nThis location reminds me of the importance of acting on what God is leading us to do.  It is easy to\nhear from him and not act on what he says.  But the blessing only come when we step into the\nfullness of his plan.\n\n\n**Responding to the Call to Prayer**\n\nAll over the Islamic world there is a call to prayer five times daily.  This is done through loud\nspeakers in many locations throughout the cities.  To westerners this is a strange practice.\n\nMany people living here comment on how oppressive this feels.  But others use it as a legitimate\nreminder to call out to God for his freedom.  People that see the call to prayer as an invitation,\nend up praying more in the middle-east than at home.\n\nIt is important to have reminders in our lives to act as triggers to pursue God.  What reminders\ncould you use everyday to help you to connect with God on a regular basis?\n\n\n**Jordan has a Key Role in God's Plan**\n\nJordan is an interesting place.  It has very few natural resources, is mostly desert, and has a very\nyoung population.  The country is led by a king, who is very loved by the people.  Jordan is the\nmost stable government in the Arab world.\n\nThe country is mostly populated by people who have migrated from what is now Israel.  Each wave of\npolitical upheaval in Israel results in more immigration to Jordan. This last year, unrest in Syria has\nalso resulted in 200,000 refugees in camps.  Conditions in these camps are extremely difficult.\n\nJordan is viewed by many as a place of refuge.  Jordan has also played a key role of peace in the\nmiddle-east. In exchange for aid from the US, Jordan plays a peace-maker role between the other\ncountries with more extreme views.\n\nThis is a tricky balance.  Pray for continued peace in Jordan so that this area of the world would\nbe open to the gospel.  Ultimately, true and lasting peace can only come from the Lord.  We are\npraying for God's transforming power on both individuals and nations.\n\n\n**Leaders Coming to Christ**\n\nI recently heard a story that I wanted to pass on.  Because of security concerns do not post this\ninformation anywhere.  The names have been changed to protect the innocent.\n\nOne day, a brother in Christ got a phone call from an important Islamic leader.  Ibrahim was a\nlittle worried, when Ahmed asked to meet with him.\n\nWhen they met Ahmed told Ibrahim that he had been reading the bible and had a lot of questions.\nThey discussed the bible for many hours, and Ahmed opened his heart to the love of Christ.  Ahmed\nwas dramatically impacted by Jesus and wanted to be baptized.  \n\nFor an important leader to come to Christ is a huge commitment. This can be a very dangerous\nsituation for all involved. Please be praying for our new brother Ahmed.  Pray for his spiritual\ngrowth and influence within the community.  Pray for wisdom to know what to do next.\n\nGod is on the move!\n\n\n**Fuel Prices Spark Riots**\n\nFuel prices in Jordan skyrocketed last week.  Cooking fuel increased by 35% as government subsidies\nwere dropped.  For about three days there were regular demonstrations all over the country.  Some of\nthe protests turned voilent, but most were calm.\n\nAlmost a week later there were still riot police gathering around the mosques where the\ndemostrations are held.  Last night we saw armoured vehicles with mounted machine guns to keep the\ndemonstrations from getting out of hand.\n\nAmy Hybels is a journalist that attends Oasis.  She posted this report.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Bi8wDuErRU\n\n\n**Partnership is the Key**\n\nHistorically, churches has squabbled and competed with one another.  This is utterly contrary to\nGod's will.  Jesus prayed that we would be one in the same way that he was united with the Father.\nThis is still his desire for us.\n\nAs people have worked in other countries it is common to come in with a superior attitude.  The\ncountries that have a rich heritage of faith assume that they have all of the answers.  This is not\nthe attitude of Christ.\n\nThe gospel in rooted in many places throughout the world.  It is vital that we recognize the work of\nGod in every place we go.  In Jordan, there is a thriving church among the Arab people.  We must\ncome alongside the church and bless them.\n\nWe must come as learners.  Our role, although important, is secondary to the role of the Jordanian\nchurch.  Our primary goal is to bless what God is already doing, and serve the church that is\nalready in place.\n\nThe spirit of partnership, is recognizing that God has given each of us a role within his kingdom.\nEach part of the body can do it's thing and then the entire body is built up and strengthened.  We\nare better together than anyone is alone.\n\nIt is a joy to serve alongside our brothers and sisters around the world.\n\n\n**Difficulty with Daily Life**\n\nI have been struck by how different daily life is here in Jordan.  Things that I simply take for\ngranted are a big deal. \n\nTransportation is the first thing that I noticed.  A trip across town is very simple in the US.  It\ncould easily take an hour to get somewhere.  Cars cost about twice what they would in the US and\ntraffic is wild.  Amman is very spread out.\n\nSometimes, when road construction is done the road is simply blocked off and people drive through\nempty lots to create a new route to where they are going. Since we have been here, there have been\nmany protests, which also block roads.\n\nPeople also put a lot of effort into getting kids to school, doing laundry and getting food, fuel,\nand water.  These things take only minor thought at home, but here, they take a major part of the\nday.\n\nLife here seams to run about an hour later than what is scheduled and last about an hour\nlonger. There is a certain level of appeal to this more relaxed pace, but it requires a conscious\nadjustment for us westerners.\n\nStrong schedules with many events planned can be a source of frustration for many Americans\nhere. Hospitality takes precedence over timeliness.  Maybe we can learn something from them.\n\n\n**The Hope of the Gospel**\n\nI look to the mountains.  Where does my help come from?  This world is seriously broken.  Being in a\ndifferent culture reveals new ways that we are broken.\n\nAll of humanity operates under the curse of sin.  Ethnic hatred, prejudice, murder, abuse, slavery,\ncorruption, and poverty are simply symptoms of this curse.  As we are willing to see, we can feel\noverwhelmed. \n\nWhere do we start to fix our world?  How can we make a difference?  Is our hope is better\ngovernment? Do we really believe that if our party wins then the world will become a magical place\nof sparkling lights?\n\nOur only hope for the world, is that God would transform peoples hearts. We must start with our own\nhearts. As my heart is transformed by the presence of God, he gives me eyes to see what he is\ndoing. \n\nFixing the world is a God-sized problem, not a man-sized one.  On our own we can do nothing. But God\ncan transform a community, nation, and world.  He invites us to be used in specific ways.  But\nultimately, he is the one that does the work.\n\nJesus invites us as his bride to work in partnership. He directs, but we respond.  He empowers, but\nwe obey.  Together we make the world a better place, not though human effort alone. But in\npartnership with the Spirit of God, we will move back the darkness.\n\n\n<------------  posted \n\n\n**Bible Training Camp**\n\nOne of the pastors in Jordan came up with a idea to train people in the bible.  It is often\ndifficult and often dangerous for people to study the bible when in their home town.  Family members\nand others in the community usually opposed to the the bible.  This can often result in violent\nretaliation for both the student and the teacher.\n\nThis pastor found that by getting people out of the country that they were much more open to the\nLord.  He has created a bible study retreat in a different country.  It is like an emersion class in\nbible study and prayer.\n\nThis has been a very effective strategy and has changed the lives of many people.  It is wonderful\nto see how different people are responding to God's call and willing to take large risks for the gospel.\n\n\n**Headlines**\n\nBuilding Bridges, Not Walls\n\nOne Person Can Make a

I have been working for one main client for four years now. I'm winding down that\ncontract and looking for new work.\n\nOur three kids are all growed up. Christine, 30, lives with us and is working for a small\nmanufacturing company. Josiah, 27, is married and working on a doctorate in Bio-informatics, at\nCU. Rachel, 24, is living in Japan where she works for the Prefecture of Kagoshima.\n\nStacie and I moved to our dream house on a lake in Windsor three years ago. We are all very happy.\n\nGreat to catch up with you.\n\nFrank:\nSo far it's been good. I work in the old Sun Microsystems division, in the Solaris team, which has a\nculture that reminds me of the old pre Carly HP. As you probably know, Mark Hurd is a big wig here,\nbut he's fundamentally the Chief Salesman, so he doesn't affect us worker bees the way he did at\nHP. Larry Ellison does believe in actually growing the company and there has been some hiring. My\nboss is very flexible and I work at home 2 days a week, which is nice as the commute from Loveland\nis long.\n\nI have heard that other parts of the company (the non Sun groups) are not as pleasant to work in.\n\nHope all is well with you and your family. Our youngest (Sam) starts college this fall. He'll be\nattending UNC in Greeley (his older sister also goes to UNC) as he wants to be a high school\nteacher.

Invitation **\n\n\"If you don't let me love you, you won't finish the race.\"\n\nWe need to learn to simply rest in God.  We need to know his passion for us.  Receiving his love\nbrings refreshment and renewal.\n\nWe need to do the things that Jesus did in order to stay connected.  We can learn to live the way\nthat Jesus lived.\n\nSpiritual disciplines can create a space where we encounter God.\n\nWe never know how in trouble we are until we slow down long enough for God to reveal it to us.\n\nSpiritual disciplines are not the sign of maturity, but rather how we achieve it.\n\nWithout embracing spiritual formation we are doomed to cycles of hitting dead-ends, resulting in\ncynicism.\n\nContemplative prayer is how we create space in our busy lives to be changed by Jesus.\n\nIntimacy (not ministry) must be at the center of our lives.\n\n\n** 2. Spiritual Disciplines **\n\nComing to Jesus is the only answer to weariness.  Matt 11:28\n\nThere are different movements in prayer:  Upward, Outward, Inward\n\nThe upward movement connects us with God's love for himself.  This includes worship, thanksgiving,\npraise, and adoration.\n\nThe outward movement connects us with God's purpose for others.  This includes petitions,\nintercession, and ministry prayer for the sick, oppressed and broken-hearted.\n\nThe inward movement connects us with God in our inner-self (motives, attitudes, and self-concept).\n\nEvangelicals are good with the first two but not the latter.\n\nIn order to really know God, I must begin to know my true self.  This is always painful.\n\nBeneath the roles and masks lies a self that only God fully knows.  It is difficult for us to follow\nGod on the journey of self-discovery.\n\nKnowing God more causes me to admit how broken I really am.  Follow Christ as he takes you into the\ndarkness of your own soul.\n\nInward disciplines create a space where the Spirit can transform us into the nature of Christ.\n\n** 3. Where we encounter ourselves **\n\nPublic self   - What I allow others to see in me.\nPrivate self  - What I hide from others.\nRevealed self - The blind spots that others see.\nUnknown self  - The things that only God knows about.\n\nThe public and private selves must be aligned with the purpose of God in our life.  But true\ntransformation occurs as God touches areas that we have not seen before.\n\nStages of growth: Awakening, Purgation, Illumination, Union\n\nAwakening    - deep awareness of God's presence in our lives\nPurgation    - removing habits, actions, and attitudes that are contrary to God's purpose\nIllumination - experiencing more of God in our joys and sorrows\nUnion        - experiencing God's emotions as we love like he loves\n\n** 4. Our Inward Journey **\n\nCultivate an internal life that sustains outwardly-focus living\n\nSpiritual disciplines provide a context for God to speak and transform our lives.\n\nGrowth is a long-term process that God leads us through\n\nSeasons of life\n * First Love\n * Learning and belonging\n * Serving\n * Surrender to God's love\n * Convergence\n * Integration\n\n** 5. Contemplative Prayer **\n\nAs place of intimacy - When we are together do we always have to discuss work?\n\nGod drives the conversation, He may take us to the abyss of sorrow, dispair, and anger. He may touch\non our place of deepest pain and dysfunction.\n\nProcess your life with God: experiences, frustrations, expectations, fears, confrontations,\nopportunities\n\nPlace of transformation from the inside out.  God's word is living and active and it illuminates our\nmotives.\n\nLearn to rest in God's presence with no specific expectations.\n\nEmbrace discovery\n\n\nSee also PrayerPractices\n", "user": 3, "title": "Prayer As A Place"}}, {"pk": 1289, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/PageCount", "time": "2014-06-15T20:40:30.271", "text": "* Page Count *                 -*-muse-*-\n\n*How long should my book be?*\n\n **50 pages -

The Lord has recently been working in me to deepen my relationship with him. He has\nbeen revealing both himself and my true nature.\n\n**Transformation**\nI have found a new longing to be with him, and simply enjoy his company.  The Lord has started a new\nwork deep within my inner-most being.  He is transforming me in surprising ways.  I welcome this work\nof renewal and realize that it is something that he is doing.\n\n**Embrace truth**\nHe is forcing me to look at the truth of who I actually am, rather than the illusion of how I\nwish that I was.  This takes courage and honesty to admit.\n\n**Source of what I need**\nI am drawn to spend more time with Jesus. This lets me draw strength and wisdom from his presence.\nIn a place of solitude I am learning to lay down my burdens, confess my failures, receive healing\nfrom hurts, expose my grief, and acknowledge foolishness and idolatry.\n\n**Fully equipped**\nIn his presence I am accepted, forgiven, empowered, and equipped for the journey.  Finally I believe\nthat this season of life will culminate with a new energy and ability to do God's work wherever I\nam.  Instead of trying harder, I will be more yielded to the purpose of God.  As I lose control,\nJesus will control me more.  I long for this new balance of power.\n\n**Aspects of renewal:**\n 1. Honesty & openness\n 2. Solitude\n 3.

Suddenly an episode of Amazing Race\nbroke out.\n\nI was so frustrated that I yanked the mouse out of the computer and\nthrew it across the room.  This immeditately seemed like it was a\nmistake so I went searching through the crowd to see if anyone had\nseen my mouse that had gone missing recently.  It was nowhere to be\nfound.\n\nMeanwhile the meeting had completely stopped and I felt a little\nresponsible. Fortunatey the next thing that happened was me waking\nup.

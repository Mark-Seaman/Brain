Engineering *                                       -*-muse-*-\n\n\nTechnology + Process + Management = Innovation\n\n**Better Technology**\n\n    Selecting the right tools and technology is an important part of every software\n    development project. Use the best available technologies that are well suited for\n    your specific business problems.\n\n    Use tools that are readily available to solve common problems. Build new tools only\n    when required to solve your unique problem.  A standard tool can often solve a problem\n    with a small fraction of the investment required by custom software.\n\n    Pick tools that are proven to produce better results. We have over 50 years of\n    combined engineering experience that makes us experts at tool selection. \n\n    Key Technologies Used:\n    * Linux\n    * Python\n    * Django\n    * Node JS\n    * Angular JS\n    * Git\n    \n\n**Better Process**\n\n    How you build software dictates the results that you will get.  The software process\n    dictates how you plan, design, implement, test, deploy, and maintain your software.\n\n    Design patterns increase leverage. Use standard solutions to common problem.  Figure\n    out the changing elements and develop standard solutions that can be applied to future\n    problems. \n\n    Create common coding patterns to leverage code resue.  Software can be reused in many\n    ways and all levels.  Define your product development strategy to maximize leverage of\n    the definition, design, libraries, and functions that you develop.\n\n    We use the following processes because they have proven to produce better results.\n    Best practices result in higher quality and lower cost.\n\n    * Frameworks increase leverage\n    * Common problems are already solved\n    * Extensive use of code generation\n    * Completely automatic testing\n    * Flexibility of custom code at the cost of off-the-shelf code\n\n\n**Better Project Management**\n\n    We deliver results weekly! This lets you see the resulting product long before it is\n    done. You define the project scope and priorities.\n\n    Redirect the engineering to match growing understanding of need.  We believe that it\n    is impossible to understand the full product at the beginning of the project.  By\n    building the product you can se and respond to the design throughout the development.\n\n    Traditional software planning defines the product details at the beginning of the\n    project.  Then the development proceeds until the most of the budget is consumed.\n    This is far too late to make meaningful changes.  We beleive that this is a serious\n    mistake that leads to failed projects.\n\n    We will send results to you so that you can see the product as it emerges. This gives\n    you the opportunity to redirect the work to match your priorities.  Do as much (or as\n    little) as you want. This flexible work engagement helps you get exactly what you want.\n\n\n**Full range of services**\n\nWe manage, create, test, and support software development.  Use us as you would your own\nengineering teams.\n\nManage\n\n    understand top business needs\n    prioritize work\n    communicate progress\n    coordinate\n\nCreate\n\n    deliver solutions to top problems\n    develop new tools for future problems\n    leverage systems for efficiency\n    rapid development and incremental deployment\n\nTest\n\n    find defects immediately\n    build automatic tests\n    leverage tools across projects\n    focus coverage on top priorities\n\nSupport\n\n    refactoring of legacy code\n    keep the system running\n    address new bix needs quickly\n    understand operations\n    embrace biz needs\n    training in best practices\n \n\n**Simple Pricing**\n\nChoosing the correct pricing model for your project. How you want to pay for your project\ndepends on a number of different factors.\n\n\nEffort-based pricing\n\n * Pay for each hour of engineering services delivered.\n * Works best if many details of the project are unknown.\n * Good fit for exploratory work.\n * Project can be guided throughout the development.\n * Maximizes flexibility.\n\nValue-based price model:\n\n * Pay for the value delivered.\n * Works best if the project is well understood.\n * Good for routine work like replacing existing functionality.\n * Requires clear understanding of project scope.\n * More expensive for exploratory projects.\n * Requires concrete and robust project specifications.\n\n[[Pricing]]\n", "user": 3, "title": "Software Engineering"}}, {"pk": 2, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "Public/ShrinkingWorld/PythonWebDev", "text": "* Python Web Developers *                                       -*-muse-*-\n\nLearn the 50 Tricks that you need to build a web application in Django.\n\n    [[FCIP][Python Web Development with Django]]\n\n    [[pyconlessons][Top 10 - Lessons from PyCon]]\n\n    [[../50-Tricks/DjangoTricks/Index][50 Tricks in Django]]\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Python Web Developers"}}, {"pk": 3, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "Public/ShrinkingWorld/FCIP", "text": "* Ft.

Creating a new book means that you create a\nplace for the book on the server and create a database that holds all\nof your content. It also displays the content of your book using a web\naddress (know as a URL) that is unique to your book.\n\nSometimes\nyou will want to delete topic completely from the database.

It is a great way to jointly develop an online book\ntogether.\n\nAs a publisher you can download a copy of the entire\nweb site as a data file.

Each\nof the unique technologies work together to bring a stable foundation\nfor the MyBook platform. Any of these technologies may be replaced by\nanother that provides improved characteristics. This chapter outline\nthe current technology stack that is used today.\n\n**Technologies**\n * Linux\n * Apache/MySQL\n * Python/Django\n * CSS/HTML\n\n**Django** \nThe most important technology decision for MyBook is the\nselection of the Django web application framework. Django is perfect\nfor these types of applications. It is easy to write shell scripts\nthat write the custom code for the application.\n\nDjango is very flexible in allowing custom code where it is needed\nwhile eliminating any repeated code structures that are common within\nweb applications. In other words it is easy to write a simple program\nthat does nothing and then grow it into a powerful application by\nincrementally adding features.\n\n**Python**\nThe Django application framework is written mostly in the\nPython programming language. Python is a very concise and powerful\nlanguage. Programmers familiar with Python are much more productive\nthan programmers using other languages. There is excellent support for\nboth high and low-level language features.\n\nPython also enjoys some of the fastest execution times for scripting\nlanguages. It is extremely portable and can run across many computer\narchitectures and operating systems.\n\n**MySQL**\nThe MyBook application saves its data in a MySQL\ndatabase. MySQL is an open-sourced implementation of the Structured\nQuery Language (SQL) that drives most databases in use today. It is\navailable free of charge. It is free to use in any way that you see\nfit.\n\nOverall it is the leading choice of developers looking for an\nalternative to the proprietary solutions provided by large\nvendors. This issue of vendor lock-in can be a significant millstone\naround the neck of any project.\n", "user": 3, "title": "Technology"}}, {"pk": 25, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "Public/ShrinkingWorld/MySlides/MySlides/DeveloperNotes", "text": "* Developer notes *                 -*-muse-*-\n\nThis chapter covers the MyBook functionality from the software\ndeveloper's perspective.

Make sure that diagnostics and engineer tools are deployed.  Sync files with contents of\nserver.\n\n2. Build new code and deploy on ethan.  Use 'set-power-on' script to configure the autoload. \n\n3. Setup cron to 'save-data' every five minutes. Confirm that cron starts up automatically.  Confirm\nthat file updates are saved.\n\n4. Use python script to configure a known accounting file.\n\n5. Confirm automatic save.\n\n6. Setup reload to 'recall-data'. Confirm that accounting is saved.\n\n7. Add 'on-shutdown' hook to run a script before the 'load' replaces the software.\n\n8. Fold all changes into initial flash card image.\n\n9.

What if we\ncould have a authentic experience with God that would last the rest of our lives?  What if by\nknowing God we could become more loving and at peace with ourselves and others?  This is the journey\nof seeking out pragmatic spirituality.\n\n________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n* 1. Peace with God\n\nLife is really pretty pointless until we can find a power beyond ourselves.  We can pursue many\nthings to try to fulfill our deepest desires.  But apart from having a relationship with God,\nnothing will ever satisfy us. Yielding control of our lives to God is an essential aspect of a rich\nlife. \n\nWe humans have an amazing capacity for self-deception.  We see things through a very distorted\nlens.  We believe things because we want to, not because they are true.  At some point in our lives\nwe must embrace absolute truth.  This is a simple acknowledgment of reality, rather than bending\nthe truth to match how we think it should be.\n\nOne of the most fascinating things about the good news of reconciliation, is that when we admit the\ntruth about ourselves we gain God's acceptance. When we acknowledge how hopeless life without God\nis, we receive his hope. With the understanding of our weakness we begin to rely on his\nstrength. This begins a phenomenal process of transformation.\n\nWe receive the provisions of the Lord as a gift.  As we understand this we can stop trying so hard\nto earn God's love. Nothing that we can do or be, is that great anyway.  We gain his favor by seeking\nrelationship with him, not by trying to do favors for him.  This changes the nature of every facet\nof our lives.\n\nWhen we spend time alone with God we find true peace.  Opening ourselves to his presence is the\nonly way to truly be at peace.  This does not occur automatically.  It happens when we consciously\nlay down our own plans and demands, and simply receive his love.  This can be a hard thing for us\nsince we live such busy lives.  But is is well worth the effort.\n\n________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n* 2. Learning to love\n\nIt is impossible to be happy and content unless we are able to receive love.  We learn from the Lord\nhow to receive love.  He desires to demonstrate his love for us in so many varied ways.  He can be\nincredibly extravagant with his love.\n\nThis experience of taking in God's love changes us.  We are then able to receive love from others.\nWe understand that the Lord has put others in our life to be a blessing.  We experience\ncompanionship, comfort, and Ecstasy in our relationships with others.\n\nAs God changes our hearts we are able to begin to love those around us. We discover that we can\nextend more mercy to family members, friends, and coworkers.  People don't seem quite as irritating\nas they once did.  This is a supernatural work.  Receiving love and mercy allows us to be more\nmerciful with other.\n\nCutting off that flow of love has the opposite effect.  We all know plenty of religious people who\nare harsh and critical.  It is possible to not know God's love and be very religious.  In fact,\npeople who know God well are not at all religious.  Religion is about keeping rules.  It has nothing\nto do with a real experience of God's love.\n\nThis process of learning to love can become so out of control that we begin to love people we don't\neven know.  We hear about people that are suffering and want to figure out a way to do something to\nhelp. Being motivated by love is completely different that feeling guilt.\n\nWe can have such a relationship with the Lord that we look for opportunities to serve others.  The\ndesire to protect the helpless is a direct result of knowing the God helped us when we were\nhelpless. The willingness to lay down our arms comes from knowing how God brought peace into our\nlives when we were his enemies.\n\n________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n* 3. Making a difference\n\nEverybody has a set of special abilities, personality, and life experiences.  These are not simply\nan accident of chance.  Your special blend was built by God for a purpose. Think of it as a\nsuper-power.  God has given you gifts and talents that he intends to use in some unique way.\n\nUnfortunately, many people go through their entire life within discovering God's unique plans.\nFinding your purpose in life is one of the greatest thrills there is.  Don't let the constant\ndemands of survival prevent you from knowing what special things that God has in store for you.\n\nAt the end of your life, the most important things you have done will be about relationships.\nInvest in the lives of others.  Start with your spouse, kids, parents, and friends.  But let is go\nbeyond that.  Live in such a way that you are a better friend to everyone that you meet than they\nare to you.\n\nLearn to forgive.  Let go of the disappointment of life.  You are guaranteed that others will let you\ndown. Don't collect those hurts as if they are some kind of treasure. They are more like frozen\nrattlers.  Leave them alone or you will feel the bite.  \n\nBe intentional about working with others.  Find as much common ground as you can. Gather partners\nwherever you go.  These come in many forms: coworkers, business partners, comrades, spouses,\ncompanions, and confidants.  Seek ways to minimize disagreement and maximize the amount of\ncooperation. \n\n________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n* 4. Accepting reality\n\nCourage and peace are two keep ingredients in a successful life.  You need boldness to make the\nchanges that must be made.  But you also need the grace to accept reality for what it is.  If you\nlack courage you will live the life of a victim; but lacking peace will lead you to be a victimizer.\n\nBefore all else fails pray.  The quality of our prayer life is one of the truest measures of\nspiritual maturity.  We can fake a lot of actions for others.  How we respond to the presence of God\nin our lives is an indicator of our true mental and spiritual health.  This includes times when he\npoints out things that we would rather not see.\n\nLearn God's strategy for you.  Because he has created each person to be completely unique, he has a\nvery special plan for you.  It is not the same as what he has for anyone else.  Finding the specific\nopportunities that are right for you is one of the great mysteries of live.  It will bring you great\njoy and tremendous satisfaction.  When you are doing what you are made for you will be the most\nsuccessful and happiest person that you could possibly be.\n\nGive it all to the Lord. He provide you with everything that you need.  Surrendering everything will\nbring you a tremendous amount of peace.  You will not feel the constant desire to control, protect,\nand hoard.  Be generous with all that you have.   And not just your possessions.  Be generous with\nyour praise, your time, and mercy for others.  Live with an open hand.\n\nBe open to new opportunities.

In the past we had an\nopen-loop system.  Watermills report data daily and this information is automatically passed on with\nonly rudimentary checking performed.  This required that people be watching the system to catch\nerrors.\n\nThe new system has a general-purpose rule checker built in.  This makes it very easy to setup rules\nthat must always be true.  Nightly and hourly there are test scripts that run to ensure that all of\nthe data in the system is valid.  The import filters for each type of data also run many of these\nrules before the data is added to the tables.\n\nIf any rule is violated then the exception is sent to the engineering staff at Watermill (currently\nMark Seaman). This email will result in an investigation.  \n\nCertain violations will be \"normal\" operation of the system.  These will be turned into alerts and\nsent to the Watermill Operations Staff for normal handling.\n\nThere will be a transition period as we turn on detectors for all of these business rules.\nInitially I expect the system to flag many issues.  Some will be false alarms, and some will point\nup real flaws in the system that have caused us much heartache.\n\nThe new tools will allow us to trace problems to their root cause very quickly.  As the we track\ndown issues and resolve them we will enter a phase where the system will be very quiet and stable.\nAll of the rules are fully automatic and don't require any person to watch the system.\n\nHere are the current set business rules:\n\n * Every mill must send accounting data nightly\n * Receipts must equal the value of the vends done\n * There must be a small gain in cumulative receipts each day\n * There must be a small gain in cumulative vends each day\n * Daily vends must reconcile with the cumulative values\n * Daily receipts must reconcile with the cumulative values\n * No prices are changed (without an exception generated)\n\n * Accounting data is exported for every mill\n * Exported data is limited to three days worth of records\n * The daily number of records in each table is not allowed to grow by more than 1%\n\n * No software version is changed (without an exception generated)\n * Every watermill is running the correct software version\n * New watermills are upgraded automatically\n * The correct diagnostics are distributed to every mill\n\n * The watermill checkup is performed nightly on every mill\n * All watermills have enough disk space\n * All watermills have a transfer process that is working\n * Every mill sends hourly logs for pressures, vends, tank level\n * Watermill logs are gathered from each mill\n * There are a small number of alerts active\n * There is at most 2 mills with a current outage\n\n * The inbox process is running and the inbox is empty\n * All types of data can be imported and manipulated for Unit 3999\n * No imported files are larger than expected\n * Executor is capable of executing commands and gathering results\n * The SQL data is exported from the database into the version control system\n * Database size grows by reasonable amount\n * Hourly data values are archived monthly\n * No unexpected file changes are on the server\n\n * Every subsystem within Support Center is working properly (eg. vends, receipts, collections, pressure, alerts, notifications, notes, dashboard, mills, contacts...)\n * Support Server is not running low on disk space.\n\nMany of these rules are already in place the remaining ones will be added over the next few weeks.\nAs additional issues are spotted by people, these will be added to the system so that they can be\ndetected automatically in the future.\n", "user": 3, "title": "Watermill Rules"}}, {"pk": 92, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/DeployTurnKey", "text": "* Deploy Turn Key *                 -*-muse-*-\n*How to deploy a Turn Key appliance to Amazon EC2*\n\nStart at the Turn Key web site https://hub.turnkeylinux.org/start/\n\n**Sign up for a Hub account**\nSign up form\nEmail activation link\nTurn Key Linux activation key -

This is a description of what happened\nand actions we are taking to repair the situation and prevent future disruptions.\n\n\nWhat happened?\n\nThe old mill server ran out of disk space on its main volume.  This caused the system to\nmalfunction.   It stopped working completely at 9:30 PM on Sunday, 3-10.   It may have had problems\nprior to that.\n\nRunning out of space creates a variety of mystery problems, since some operations will succeed and\nothers will fail.\n\nAll data traffic from the watermills goes through the old mill server.  All traffic was blocked\nstarted and 9:30 PM, Sunday.\n\nAll data from the watermills was deposited into the local storages in the home directory for the\nWatermill user.  This is not on the same volume that ran out of space.\n\nThe command that sends data to the production server was blocked causing the data traffic to be\nblocked.\n\n\nHow we found the issue\n\nThe automatic tests reported massive failures from the blocked traffic.  Testing on the production\nserver confirmed that everything there was functioning properly.\n\nThe inbox on the old mill server contained several hundred files that were blocked.\n\nThe inbox script was running, but the files were not being processed.  The forwarding command was\nrunning properly but the import command would hang when executed manually.\n\nRestarting the process did not fix the issue.  Showing the available disk space on all volumes\nrevealed that the root volume was completely out of space.\n\nInvestigation reveals that a large amount of space was used by the Git repos.  The largest repo is\ntied to the old mill server.  This repo grows nightly and was responsible for the problem.\n\n\nWhat repair actions were taken?\n\nTo fix the immedate problem, I removed some old repos that are no longer needed.  This freed up 12\nGB immediately.\n\nThen with the system running properly.  I pushed all alert files through the system.  There were 84\nfiles to be processed.  I confirmed that these went all the way through the system.\n\nThe accounting files were also processed by reimporting them into the inbox.  This resulted in all\nof the accounting being brought up to date.  There were 124 files for accounting.  Mannually trigger\nthe export of the accounting data to Wex Net.\n\nNext, all of the log files were imported.  We had 363 files for tank, vends, and pressure.\n\nTesting of the system will continue throughout the day on Monday.\n\n\nHow can we prevent this in the future?\n\nThe root cause of the problem is the growth rate of the server git repo.  This has already been\naddressed for the new server repo.  This was fixed for the new repo in January.  There is also a\ntest in place for disk usage on the new server.\n\nA new test will be added for the disk space on the old server.  We will also make some changes for\nthe growth rate of the repo itself.\n\n\nSummary\n\nThe loss of disk space resulted in a temporary outage of the watermill server.  The problem has now\nbeen resolved with no data loss.  Additional testing and fixes will be setup to defend against this\ntype of problem and minimize the impact in the future.\n\nPlease report any additional problems you may see.\n\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Wm After Action Report"}}, {"pk": 109, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/ActionCycle", "text": "* Action Cycle *                 -*-muse-*-\n\nOptimize the return on investment\n\n**Learn**\nListen and observe\nIntegrate multiple streams of thought\nTry to identify the most important problem to solve\nSet an agenda for learning and growth\n\n**Plan**\nStart now, but start small\nDo one thing that makes sense by itself\nBuild for long-term success\nAddress problems before making new ones\n\n**Build**\nCreate something new\nIntegrate everything you know\nCompare to your current expecations\nFollow up on every success\n\n**Teach**\nInvite new partnerships\nBuild and extend influence\nKnow what you have to offer\nCollaborate more\n\n\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Action Cycle"}}, {"pk": 110, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/Business", "text": "Business                 -*-muse-*-\n    propose test strategy to Brant and Chad\n    SimpleApps\n    [[Plan]] - imagine/envision*\n    [[Work]] - client projects*\n    CompanyGrowth\n        Business Vision\n            5 employees in 2013\n            Revenue of 1 Million/year (personal profit $200)\n            5 life-long clients\n            High-value engineering\n        BusinessStrategy\n            StableOperatingPoints\n            BusinessPractices\n            BusinessPolicies\n            Reusable assets\n            Services To Products\n        Business Plan\n            Personal engineering\n            Team leader\n            Business partner\n            Product development\n        CareerGoals\n            My purpose and strengths\n            MyBusinessStory\n            Personal objectives\n            Tracking the plan\n    ProjectManagement\n        [[Communication]]\n            Daily stand-up\n            Active project list\n            Weekly report to clients\n            Business planning meetings\n        PlanningProcess\n            Prioritized backlog\n            Single tasking\n            Incremental\n            Automatic testing\n        ProjectTracking\n            Done list\n            To do list (enhancements, defects)\n            Sprint planning\n            Testing\n        ManagementPractices\n            Balanced actions: test,fix,extend,improve\n            Personel practices\n            Monthly objectives\n            Balancing multiple projects\n    [[Marketing]]\n        Marketing Strategy\n            Find prospective clients and partners\n            Develop trust\n            Learn about their needs\n            Identify opportunity for collaboration\n        Business Relationships\n            Prospects\n            Clients\n            Workers\n            Partners\n        Value Proposition\n            Easy to work with\n            Lots of experience\n            Technical assets\n            Able to learn/flexibility\n        Selecting Opportunities\n            People I want to work with\n            Need what we offer\n            Similar to past projects\n            Few new skills to learn\n    [[Engineering]]\n        Engineering Practices\n            TestDriven\n            [[Automation]]\n            Agile Software Development\n            Software Reuse\n        Technology Selection\n            Core languages\n            Core frameworks\n            Core process\n            Growth technologies\n        Skill Mapping\n            Training Engineers\n            Skills Buildory\n            Project Estimation\n            Hiring Plan\n        Technology skills\n            SimpleSites\n            Automatic testing framework\n            Remote system admin & management\n            Agile custom software\n", "user": 3, "title": "Business"}}, {"pk": 111, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/PrayForWork", "text": "* Pray For Work *                 -*-muse-*-\n\nLord, the ability to work comes from you.

The Lord has recently been working in me to deepen my relationship with him. He has\nbeen revealing both himself and my true nature.\n\n**Transformation**\nI have found a new longing to be with him, and simply enjoy his company.  The Lord has started a new\nwork deep within my inner-most being.  He is transforming me in surprising ways.  I welcome this work\nof renewal and realize that it is something that he is doing.\n\n**Embrace truth**\nHe is forcing me to look at the truth of who I actually am, rather than the illusion of how I\nwish that I was.  This takes courage and honesty to admit.\n\n**Source of what I need**\nI am drawn to spend more time with Jesus. This lets me draw strength and wisdom from his presence.\nIn a place of solitude I am learning to lay down my burdens, confess my failures, receive healing\nfrom hurts, expose my grief, and acknowledge foolishness and idolatry.\n\n**Fully equipped**\nIn his presence I am accepted, forgiven, empowered, and equipped for the journey.  Finally I believe\nthat this season of life will culminate with a new energy and ability to do God's work wherever I\nam.  Instead of trying harder, I will be more yielded to the purpose of God.  As I lose control,\nJesus will control me more.  I long for this new balance of power.\n\n**Aspects of renewal:**\n 1. Honesty & openness\n 2. Solitude\n 3.

It is easy to believe that work is all there is to life.  But the ''To Do'' list never\nrelents.  The Sabbath forces a break to this thinking.  It lets us recreate to re-create our souls.\nThank You for this gift.\n\nI want to just \"be\" in Your presence.  I want to live InThePresent and the Sabbath is a good way to\nstart.  You are God, I am not.\n\nTo have a meaningful Sabbath Rest it is important to do activities that are fundamentally different\nthan the regular work activities. I work on computers for a living, so working on computers as a\nbreak is insane. I need activities that involve working with my hands, riding bikes, hiking, or\nplaying guitar.

What makes Emacs so special?  There are a large number of\ntools that you must master to succeed.  The last thing any of us need is another tool with a\ncomplicated learning curve.\n\n\n**Return on investment**\nWhat percentage of your time is spent editing text?   If you are a software developer, like me, or\nan author, then you may expect to invest a lot of time typing words into a computer.  I average about\n9 hours on the computer each day.  About 75% of this time is editing text, the rest is mostly\nreading on the internet or a book on my tablet.\n\nI expect to work for another 15 years, and expect to log about 60 hours a week doing some kind of\ncomputer interaction.  This totals to about 3000 hours a year, with 75% of the time editing text.\nRealistically, I expect to spend over 33,000 hours writing.\n\nI believe that my productivity at editing has doubled in the last year from switching to Emacs.\nThis will certainly save me thousands of hours over the rest of my carreer.  This is the single\nlargest gain that you can make related to computer usage.\n\n\n**Choose the big lever**\nEmacs is very complicated to use.  It has a nearly vertical learning curve. It is frustrating at first\nto learn enough to do basic tasks without thinking seriously.  But it is also extremely powerful.\nThere is both a big cost and big reward for switch to Emacs.\n\nEmacs is readily available on any operating system that you will ever care about.  That is what\nprotects any investment that you make to learn it.   Learning to become a master at Emacs will\nrequire you about 30 hours.  After making this level of investment you will be significantly more\nproductive that you currently are.\n\nAfter you have made the initial investment you will have unexpected gains in many daily routines.\nEntire tasks that used to take a significant amount of time will simply evaporate.  You will find\nyourself with a lot of extra time to thing through bigger problems. All types of repeated work will\nbecome largely automatic with the features provided by Emacs.\n\n\n**Learning strategy**\nWhen I learned Emacs, I just jumped into the deep end of the pool.  I read a book, \"Pragmatic\nThinking and Learning\", by Andy Hunt.  In the book he mentioned the importance of learning how to\nget good at editing text and challenged me to learn Emacs.\n\nI decided to go for it!  I installed it and within a few minutes was completely overwhelmed.  There\nis just too much to learn, and I needed to still get my job done.  I took a weekend and figured out\nthe basics. Then continued to push forward.  Eventually I crested the hill and got where I needed to\nbe.\n\nThe resulting experience is this book.  By following the path that is laid out here, you can arrive\nat the same place with a lot less effort.  This book will give you a map for where you are going\nbefore you embark.\n\n\n**Pace yourself**\nEveryone has their own pace.  Find one that is right for you.  Consider investing an hour each day\nover the next month to work through this book.  This will get you into the \"Thriving Zone\" within a\nmonth. \n\nThere are two transformations taking place simulataneously.  You are learning new concepts and ideas\nabout how to use a new tool to speed up your work.  This is fairly straight forward.  \n\nThe second part is not nearly as easy to master.  You are retraining your automatic responses.  This\nfeels a lot like when you first learned to drive a car.  Your mind knows what you want to do but\nyour fingers will not follow along.\n\nAllow yourself time to let your fingers automatically find the right keys.   Analyse the way that\nyou do things and make small adjustment until the editor does exactly what you think it should do.\n\nIf you believe that typing \"Control-L\" should sort the lines in your buffer then that is the right\nanswer for you.  When this process is complete you will have a super-personal editor that no one\nelse in the world has.\n\n\n**More than typing**\nEditing text files is important.  You will see how to efficiently create and manipulate text\ndocuments.  After all, Emacs is a text editor at its core.  But there are a lot of other interesting\ntopics that are worth exploring.\n\nMost of the things written to help people learn about Emacs focus on the features and aspect of the\nprogram.  We are going to take a different approach.  Instead of learning about all of the things\nthat you can do, we will start with the needs that you have. \n\nEach day will focus on some key aspect that might need.  It will introduce the \"Big Idea\" and give\nyou some pointer.  It will also point you in the direction of getting more help and other resources\nyou might consider.\n\n\n**Two levels of learning**\nEach topic will have a key concept to understand.  You will get an idea of why this topic is\nimportant to you and some overall pointers.  For some people this may be the only learning that you\nneed.  You may consider going through every topic and picking off only the big ideas.\n\nFor others you will want to go deeper.  There should be enough meat for you to digest and mull\nover.  There are also excerises that you can try and other resources to follow.\n\nI recommend reading through the high level ideas of each topic, in order to decide if you want to\ninvest the energy to learn Emacs.  If you do then work through the more detailed sections in any\norder that you want.\n\n\n**Happy travels!**\nYou have already started on a excellent journey.  You now know more about emacs that 99% of the\npeople on the plannet.  Let's see if we can push that even further in the next month.\n\n\nSee also [[Emacs]]\n\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Why Bother  with Emacs?"}}, {"pk": 145, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/WritingProjectOutline", "text": "* Writing Project Outline *                 -*-muse-*-\n\n**Article Template**\nWriting process for each article: plan, draft, edit, share  (30 min each)\n\n**Project Template**\nEach new project must go through a series of phases: 80 hours\n 1. brilliant idea & outline                        -- 2 hours\n 2. five articles (2500 words)                      -- 10 hours\n 3. microbook articles (21 articles, +10000 words)  -- 30 hours\n 4. edited articles (10k words, $200)               -- 10 hours\n 5. automatic email and web site (200 subscribers)  -- 20 hours\n 6. kindle book release ($8, 1000 customers)        -- 10 hours\n\nSee also [[Writing]]\n\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Writing Project Outline"}}, {"pk": 146, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/MyBosses", "text": "* My Bosses *                 -*-muse-*-\n\n81 Kent Wilken\n82 Peter Galen\n83 Mark Anderson\n84 Ken Anderson\n85 Bob Sobol\n85 Gordon Nuttall\n85 Ben Kimball\n86 Dean Buck\n86 Dennis Perry\n87 Sterling Mortensen\n88 Steve Henry\n91 Rick Lesser\n92 Bob Chalstrom\n93 Shelly Lehmeier\n94 Jb Erickson\n95 Don Stavely\n96 Don Watt\n98 Eric Williams\n99 Larry Chapman\n01 John Dutton\n02 Greg Brake\n06 Sandy Lewis\n\n\nSee also MyStories, MyLifeStory\n\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "My Bosses"}}, {"pk": 147, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/GeicoInsurance", "text": "* Geico Insurance *                 -*-muse-*-\n\nPrint ID cards\nHouse insurance (flood)\n\n**2011-07-29**\npaid for flood insurance\nwill be active on 8-29\nmay not need general liability insurance\nmay be better to have professional liability insurance\npaid for umbrella policy with credit card\n\n\nSee also [[Brain]]\n\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Geico Insurance"}}, {"pk": 148, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/BusinessPrinciples", "text": "* Business Principles *                 -*-muse-*-\n\n1.

We operate based on principles and\npractices that allow us to produce more value than any competitor.  We build life-long partnerships\nwith others.  We execute projects using the best practices available.\n\nShrinking World Solutions is built on several core ideas.  From these a set of operating practices\ngovern the daily activities of the company.\n\n\n** Principles of Business **\n\nWhat are the unchanging principles that make your business tick?\n\n1. **Agile** - we only do what must be done\n \nThere are an infinite number of things that could be done to grow the company.  But many of these\ngood things, are not essential.  We are committed to delay actions until they are really\nneeded. This allows us to concentrate on the essential tasks that produce immediate value.\n\n2. **Trust** - we aim for life-long partnerships\n\nAll relationships are built on trust.  We seek to conduct ourselves in such a way to build trust\nwith our partners (clients, employees, colleagues).  These relationships are more vital to the\nlong-term health of the business than short-term profits.\n\n3. **Value** - we look for 10 times ROI\n\nThere are many problems that could be worked on.  We select the problems that produce the largest\nbenefit for the effort expended.  Most businesses have pressing problems that cost the business a\ngreat deal of money.  We hope to achieve results that are ten times the cost of the solution.\n\n4. **Solutions** - we solve pressing problems quickly and elegantly\n\nWe believe that simplicity is the key to great solutions.  Often a simple solution that is put in\nplace immediately is far superior to a more complete solution that takes a long time to implement.\n\n5. **Best Practices** - we do what works\n\nWe have spent decades learning and sharing best practices in software development techniques.  When\nyou hire us you benefit from the learning and experimentation.   This allows us to quickly implement\nlasting improvements to your technology and processes.\n\n6. **Open** - we freely share everything we can\n\nWe believe that ideas are best when shared.  We invite you to join with us in mutual collaborations\nthat can be share with others.  We believe that businesses win by sharing because they can move\nfaster than their competitors.  The days of protectionism are over.  We freely share any \ngeneral-purpose knowledge and techniques with our clients.\n\n\nSee also [[Business]], BusinessPractices\n", "user": 3, "title": "Business Policies"}}, {"pk": 150, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/ProjectDocs", "text": "* Project Docs *                 -*-muse-*-\n\nMany projects have docs.\nData driven applications are mostly defined by documents.\nIt is important to manage both app docs and code together.\nA git repo is used to track each project.\nThe core source code must be clearly identified.\nDoc replication and linking should be done through update.tst.\n\n\nSee also JackHammer \n\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Project Docs"}}, {"pk": 151, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/Plan", "text": "Plan                  -*-muse-*-\n\n    **Time allocation categories**\n    admin\n    business\n    tools\n    writing\n    growth\n    people\n    fun\n\n    AnalysisJournal\n    PlanningHorizons\n    [[Activities]]\n    DailyActionPlan\n    [[Microplan]]\n    Other Planning\n        time map\n        review [[Projects]]\n        MarketingPlan - update plan\n        calculate income deficit 2012 (on Dec 1, 2012: $11,000)\n", "user": 3, "title": "Plan"}}, {"pk": 152, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/ProgressModel", "text": "* Progress Model *                 -*-muse-*-\n\nProgress must be: Sustainable, Incremental, Measureable\n\n**Learn** - Knowledge\n\n * Mastery motive\n * Book list\n * Missing important skils debt\n\n**Plan** - Projects\n\n * Autonomy motive\n * Project list\n * Lack of vision and prioritization\n\n**Build** - Solutions\n\n * Purpose motive\n * Objectives\n * Unsolved problems are debt   \n\n**Teach** - People\n\n * Relationship motive\n * Writing\n * Communication debt leading to lack of trust\n\n\nSee also [[Brain]], TalentThemes\n\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Progress Model"}}, {"pk": 153, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/CronTab", "text": "* Cron Tab *                 -*-muse-*-\nHow to set up a cron table to schedule automatic tasks\n\n**Cron Tab Fields**\nminute\nhour\nday of month\nmonth\nday of week (0=Sun)\n\n**User scripts**\nhourly\ndaily\nweekly\nmonthly\n\nSee also ComputerSetup\n\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Cron Tab"}}, {"pk": 154, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/WmIceTransport", "text": "* Wm Ice Transport *                 -*-muse-*-\n*\nDesign notes for Ice Transport*\n\nWmEventPattern\nreplace messages with vars (in)\nreplace messages with vars (out)\n\n**unit test**\nauger jam\neach phase with multiple atempts\n\nsimplify functions\n\n\n**Old handlers:**\n\n    'ChooseIceBag\n    'ChooseIceBulk10\n    'ChooseIceBulk20\n    'Start\n    'Stop\n    'VendingTimeout\n\n    'IceTransportError\n    'TransportDone\n\n    'NotReady\n    'Ready\n    'AugerJam\n    'AugerOk\n\n    'IceTransportPhase1\n    'IceTransportPhase2\n    'IceTransportPhase3\n    'Timeout\n\n\n**New handlers**\n\nEvents In:\n    iceC.start10Pounds\n    iceC.start20Pounds\n    iceC.stop\n\n    iceC.augerJam\n    iceC.error.iceScale\n\nEvents Out:\n    iceC.error.iceTransport\n    iceC.transportInProgress\n\n    iceC.augerStart\n    iceC.augerStop\n\n    iceC.agitaterStart\n    iceC.agitaterStop\n\nVariables:\n    // Times in seconds\n    C_bagInflater_bagInflationLastTimeSeconds\n    iceC.vendingTimeoutSeconds\n    iceC.transportTimeLimitSeconds\n\n    // Time in ms\n    iceC.augerRateMilliPoundsPerSecond\n    iceC.minimumAgitationTimeMs\n    iceC.transportPauseTimeMs\n    iceC.estimatedAugerTimeMs\n\n    // Weights are in milli-pounds\n    iceC.scaleWeight\n    iceC.largeIceWeight\n    iceC.smallIceWeight\n    iceC.lastIceWeight\n    iceC.weightRemaining\n    iceC.starvedAugerThreshold\n    iceC.endGameWeight\n    iceC.closeEnoughWeight\n\n\nSee also WmProjects\n\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Wm Ice Transport"}}, {"pk": 155, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/LawsOfSubstraction", "text": "* Laws Of Substraction *                 -*-muse-*-\n\nImportant Descisions\n1.

From December to April I began creating regular habits of daily, weekly, and\nquarterly quiet times.\n\nBut recently, this time has tapered off.  I have become preoccupied with the concerns of my life and\nless focused on the concerns of the kingdom of God.  I really want to recapture this habit and want\nto seek God every week.  I need the Spirit speaking to me on a regular basis.\n\nHere is what I would like to commit to:\n * Daily quiet time of 30 minutes\n * Weekly quiet time of 2 hours\n * Quarterly quiet time of 12 hours\n\nDuring this time one of the challenges that I have is to focus on the Spirit of God and his work in\nme.  Many other ideas, concerns, and agendas seem to creep in and take over.  I need to build a\ncertain amount of structure to support the focus on what God is wanting to do.\n\nSee also PrayerPractices\n\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Personal Log"}}, {"pk": 177, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/OpenSSH", "text": "* Open SSH *                 -*-muse-*-\n\nBy Jonathan Moeller - Last updated: Thursday, October 29, 2009 - Save & Share - 21 Comments\n\nOne of Linuxs more useful features is its ability to permit secure, encrypted remote access. Secure\nShell technology (SSH) permits you to control a remote computer without having actual physical\naccess to the machine. SSHs network traffic is encrypted, and assuming you configure SSH correctly,\nquite secure.  Ubuntu Linux has always had strong support for SSH, and Karmic Koala 9.10 is no\ndifferent. You can use an SSH implementation called OpenSSH Server to remotely, securely access your\nmachine.\n\nHeres how to install and perform a basic security configuration of OpenSSH Server on Ubuntu 9.10\nKarmic Koala.\n\nFirst, youll need to install OpenSSH Server. To do so, open up a Terminal window and type the\nfollowing command:\n\nsudo apt-get install openssh-server\n\napt-get will then download and install OpenSSH Server. Depending upon the speed of your computer and\nInternet connection, the installation may take several minutes.\n\nOnce the installation has finished, return to the Terminal. Well need to make a few changes to your\n/etc/ssh/sshd_config file in order to increase SSHs security. First, however, well want to make a\nbackup copy of your sshd_config file in case anything goes wrong. Type this command into the\nTerminal:\n\nsudo cp /etc/ssh/sshd_config ~\n\nThis will make a backup copy of the sshd_config file in your home directory.\n\nNext, well need to edit the sshd_config file itself:\n\nsudo gedit /etc/ssh/sshd_config\n\n(Obviously you can use vi or emacs or the editor of your choice instead, though newer Linux users\ntend to find gedits GUI easier to use.)\n\nOnce youre editing the file, youll want to add the following two directives to the end of the file:\n\nPermitRootLogin no\n\nAllowUsers USERNAME\n\nPermitRootLogin no will block root from logging in via SSH. Its best to never enable root SSH\naccess, since if an attacker happens to figure out the root password, he or she will have total\nremote control over your system.\n\nAllowUsers adds an additional layer of protection by only allowing specific users to connect via\nSSH. For instance, if you wanted only users test1 and test2 to have SSH access, you would set\nAllowUsers as AllowUsers test1 test2.\n\nYou may also want to consider changing the Ports directive. By default SSH runs over TCP/IP port 22,\nwhich means that any malware bot autoscanning port 22 can target it. Changing the Ports directive to\nsomething different will make SSH run over a different, blocking some of those automated cracking\nattempts.\n\nOnce you have finished changing your settings, save the sshd_config file, and restart the SSH daemon\nwith this command:\n\nsudo /etc/init.d/ssh restart\n\nYou should now be able to SSH into your Ubuntu machine from another system with an SSH client.\n\n\nSee also ComputerSetup\n", "user": 3, "title": "Open SSH"}}, {"pk": 178, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/CreateCommand", "text": "* Create Command *                 -*-muse-*-\n\nThe reason that Unix rocks, is that it is very easy to create powerful tools by snapping pieces\ntogether.  Think of it as an erector set that can be used to assemble cool things.  Linus did a very\ncool thing by making this open to the masses.\n\nThe beginning of your automation framework is a single command.  This command is the command you\nwill use to build every other command you need.  It is like asking the Genie for a thousand wishes\nas your first wish.\n\nCreate a command called 'cmd-new'.  Put the follow content in it.\n\n    #!/bin/bash\n    # Create a new command\n    \n    name=$b/$1\n    cat <<EOF  > $name\n    #!/bin/bash\n    # $2\n    echo $2\n    EOF\n    \n    chmod 755 $name\n    e $name\n\nEach time you run this command it will create a new command with name matching the first argument.\nIt assumes that '$b' points to the directory with your commands.\n\nThis script sets the new command to be executable.  Then it runs your text editor on the file.\n\ncmd-new will let you create any new command with about 5 seconds of overhead.  Think about why this\nis important.\n\nIn the world of programming, abstraction is everything.  It lets you elevate your thinking.  You go\nfrom thinking about how to do something to thinking about the result you want.\n\nLet me illustrate with a simple result.  Type 'cd;du|sort -nr|head' in a terminal.  See what it\ndoes? It finds the ten biggest hogs in your home directory.\n\nNow put that in a command with \n\n    $ cmd-new showhogs \"# Show disk hogs\"\n\nNow look at the detailed implementation of the command.  It is very terse.  There is not much typing\nsaved.  But there is a lot of thinking saved.

in 50 hours (100 pages in 50 days)** working 1 hour/day\n\n300 pages is typical book length.  Commit to 1 hour per day and youre able to write 2 pages per\nhour. To write a short book of 100 pages will take 50 days. 100 pages per book/2 pages per hour, or\n50 hours.\n\n**250 words per page** is generally considered to be standard. \n\nManuscriptLength\nThis standard was set in earlier times, when most manuscripts were prepared on typewriters with\nfixed pitch (monospace) fonts. Even though times have changed, and many more fonts and text options\nare now available to the writer, the old guideline of 250 words per page is still the norm.\n\n\"Publishers' word count requirements were set up back in the days of typewriters when Courier was\nthe only option. Therefore, word counts are still based on the standards of 25+ years ago. Most\npublishers these days will accept manuscripts in any clear, easily readable font, but there is a\nlingering belief among certain authors that only Courier is acceptable for manuscripts...\n\nMany category editors find it easier to judge the length of a book in the way they've always done:\nknowing exactly how many book pages a manuscript of, say, 200 pages in Courier at 250 words per page\nis going to translate into when it becomes a finished product.\n\nIn actuality, however, most editors now accept Times New Roman since it is the 'default' font on\nmost personal computers. (Also, it saves a tree due to using less paper.) I've also heard from\nvarious authors, via e-mail loops, that they use other fonts. The 'must' is that the font be easy\nfor an editor to read... IMPORTANT: Whatever font you decide to use, you will need to experiment to\nfind out how many pages your manuscript would have been if written in Courier, as this is the only\nway you will be able to accurately compare your word count to the publishers'...\n\nWHITE SPACE. Manuscripts are counted by page rather than computer word count because authors write\nwith varying amounts of 'white space'...  It's possible a page with a good deal of narrative might\ncontain 300+ words, while a page with lots of short dialogue might be not more than 200. Therefore,\nthe editor has to think in terms of number of pages, not the number of words.\"\n\nBlair Bancroft: Word Count\nhttp://www.blairbancroft.com/word_count.htm\n\n\"Word count: based on 25 lines per page in Courier New 12 pt. averages approximately 250 words per\npage. 20 pages, an average chapter, =25,000; 200 pages=50,000; 400 pages=100,000; 600 pages=150,000;\n800=200,000 words. Most books are between 50 and 100,000 words long.  Publishers estimate by pages,\nincluding the white space. A computer count of 50,000 words may be 65,000 in publishers' terms. If\nyou use a computer word count note it on the front of the ms.\"\n\nDaphne Clair/Laurey Bright: Approaching a publisher  \nhttp://homepages.paradise.net.nz/dclair/approachingeds.html\n\n\"Page Counts In most cases, industry standard preferred length is 250 words per page... so a 400\npage novel would be at about 100,000 words. If you want to see what size book is selling in your\ngenre, take a look on the shelves. If the average length is 300 pages, you're looking at a 75,000\nword manuscript (approximately).\"\n\nFiction Factor: How Long Should Your Story

In fact, there is no job in sight.\nWhat do you do?  How can you process the journey of job search and live to tell the tale? Learn the\ntips that will let you have fewer sleepless nights and more peace each day.\n\nI recently found myself in the pool of job seekers.  It felt a little like those grade-B horror\nmovies where the zombies stagger around looking for some unidentifiable objective.  But in this case\nwe are looking for meaningful work.  Everything in our life seems hinged on this one goal.\n\nHere are some observations about things that I have learned during my job search.  Hopefully these\nideas will benefit you on your journey.\n\nMastering the job search puzzle really requires solving four separate puzzles.  Each of these areas\nmust be resolved for us to feel that we are making progress and positioning ourselves for success.\n\n * Purpose - we must discover the reason to go to work\n * Path - we must go on an emotional journey and grow personally\n * Process - we must learn the techniques for how to land a job\n * People - we must share the journey with those we trust\n\nTake a few minutes and write out your thoughts about how you are dealing with each of these areas.\nDoes any area stand out as needing more attention?  If so, focus on this area over the next day.\nIdentify ways that you might make changes to improve how you feel about it.\n\n\n* Find Your Purpose\n\nA sense of purpose can be a tricky thing.  But it is absolutely essential to the success of your job\nsearch.  If you aim at nothing you are sure to hit it.\n\nStart by discovering your superpowers. These include your hidden talents or special abilities.  Each\nperson has a unique personality.  There are no clones.  Your personality gives you a unique\npotential that no one else has.  It also disqualifies you from certain things that may come\nnaturally to others.  Respect your uniqueness and identify the traits that make you special.\n\nEach of us have situations where we know that we will thrive and others where we will die. Over the\nnext week, keep a list of each time you have been thrilled or drained.  Try to capture at least\nfive snapshots each day.  Analyze these to find the common threads.  Now imagine constructing a job\nenvironment where you experience all the thrills and avoid all the drains.  What does this teach you\nabout your job search?\n\nYour life has been a unique experience.  No one else has had your same a assets or liabilities.\nMake a list of these things in order to identify how to leverage them to get your perfect job.  Your\nactions to get the job should be customized to your special personality.  Leverage what you have in\norder to get the greatest gain.\n\nAn employer, client, or customer is only asking one question.   \"Do you bring more value than you\ncost?\"  Find creative ways to answer this question in their minds.  If you do, then you may not even\nhave to interview.  A demonstration of the value that you bring is much more important than what\nyour resume says.  Attempt to win the job before the race even starts.\n\nAttend events where you know your prospective employers hang out.  Show them that you can be the one\nto solve their problems.  This will make you the one indispensible choice for the position that you\nwant. Create your own dream job.\n\n\n* Find Your Path\n\nChange affect all of us in profound ways.  Use the stress of a job search to grow personally.\nUnderstanding the stages that the transition will bring will help to minimize the discomfort that we\nfeel. Pain is inevitable but growth is optional. By recognizing the stages of change we can know\nwhen we need courage to act or acceptance for things that are outside of our control.\n\nEnding is the first stage in the emotional journey of job search.  We must identify the loss of\nwhatever the old job offered us.  We need to be able to understand the loss to celebrate the good\nthings that we enjoyed.  Then we can truly accept the reality and mourn the loss with friends.\n\nThe gap between the ending and the beginning is a time of turmoil.  This period is a tunnel of chaos\nwhere anything can happen.  We have times when all hope is gone.  Each time there is a glimmer we\nput all of our hope on that one thing.  Then when it collapses we feel crushed.  This is a time to\nfocus on the important task of growing emotionally so that our confidence is based on something more\nthan the last conversation that we had.  Involve others close to you.  Draw encouragement from them.\n\nThe new beginning starts when we choose to get off the emotional roller-coaster.  This may be long\nbefore we actually get a job.  It starts when we feel a solid foundation.  At that point we know\nthat the external situation will be faced with restored confidence.\n\nEventually you will receive the fullfillment of your goals by getting the new job.  But the critical\nbattle is fought internally with our own fears.  This is a critical time when we need others to draw\nclose and surround us with their love.  We are always better together.  Don't face these challenges alone.\n\n\n* Find Your Process\n\nThe standard process for getting a job is completely broken for most people.  You may want to try to\ncreate your own process, at least as a part of your overall job search strategy.  Consider the\nfollowing instructions for ninja job search.\n\nCreate a list of 40 companies you want to consider. Spent 40 minutes, building four different\nlists. List companies you have already been thinking about (in 10 minutes).  Use indeed.com to\nsearch for opennings in your field (in 10 minutes).  Don't visit the details, just locate the\nopenings. List people you know where you would like their job. Search for companies in the news\nusing Google.  Spend 10 minutes on each list and have your top-40 in forty minutes.\n\nTurn your list of 40 companies into a table.  Columns include: Company, Contact(y/n), Postings(y/n),\nExcited.  Use indeed.com to find out if the company is hiring people like you.  You ninja strategy\nis to skip the application process in favor of getting to know an insider. You will research each\ncompany enough to learn if it is a good fit for you.\n\nYour contact inside the company is your most important source of information about the company.\nThey are also your most critical ally. Locate an advocate that will help you understand the hiring\nprocess and ask for an informational interview.\n\nUse what you learn to reprioritize your list of companies.  Make sure to follow up on all of the\nleads generated through the process and to thank everyone who will spend time with you.  Rearrange\nyour schedule to put you in contact with as many people as possible and look for opportunities to\nconnect with others.\n\nHow excited you feel about a particular company is the most important indicator of the motivation\nthat you have to pursue them. Start with the company that you are most excited about, and work your\nway down.  You have a deep bench but you will probably generate a job in the first 10-15 companies\nthat you work on.\n\nSend email to people that you have not met in order to get an informational interview.  Seek out\nanother contact if the first does not respond in three days. Repeat this overall process until you\nget hired.  For more details on the process read, \"2-hour Job Search\".  Easy read and great ideas\nfor all of the steps.\n\n\n* Find Your People\n\nA job search is an excellent time to deepen connections with others.  You may be more open than at\nany other time to both give and receive from others.   If you are a skilled professional you may\nstill be a novice job seeker.   This may be a newly found area of incompetence.  Others can help you\nwith advice and encouragement that you need.\n\nConsider finding a mentor that can speak to you about the things that you need to hear. Also find\nways that you can mentor others with insights that you have.  Both of these relationships are built\non trust and you will need that connection during this time.  It is also great to develop your\nrelationships with peers that you can get an objective view from.  Join a support group to work\nthrough possibilities for companies together.\n\nBeef up you professional network using modern tools like Linked In, and Meetup.com.  Become active\nin your professional organizations as well as job search groups.  This is no time to sit at home.\nIt is a time to be around people as much as possible.\n\nVolunteer your time by looking for opportunities to serve that also have a strategic benefit for\nyou. Use the time to learn a new skill or refresh old ones. Look for a creative break-through while\nyou have a community presence.  Always keep an attitude of service to others.\n\nThis is time to create a deeper connection with those around you. Trust is built by people taking\nrisks and having those rewarded.

This is the first time\nthat I have been able to attend Pycon.  It is very exciting to be interacting with so many fantastic\npeople.\n\n**Pyramid Tutorial**\n\nI attended a four-hour tutorial on Pyramid, which is a Python framework, with the goal of building\nsmall web applications quickly that can scale into complex applications.  Many frameworks are good\nat either but not both.\n\nDuring the tutorial we installed all of the tools, learned about the technology, and built a simple\nweb application.  I can now use this to build other apps.\n\n**Effective Django**\n\nThis tutorial assumed the ability to build simple applications.   It dealt with all of the issues\nthat porfessional developers need to build apps successfully.\n\nIt gave a set of best practices, many of which I was already using, but several I was not.   The key\ninsights that were gained, included use of Selenium for testing of the UI, and Class Based Views\nthat allow for greater code resue in the UI front-end.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\n**pycon - day 2**\n\n**Test-Driven Django**\n\nThis tutorial covered the tools and techniques for doing test driven development with a Django\napplication.  It covered both how to do effective unit testing and functional testing.  We set up\nSelenium to both control and test the page elements that the web browser will see.  I will be using\nall of these techniques on all current and future projects.\n\n**Heroku**\n\nHeroku is a web deployment platform that takes all of the pain out of deployment.  It is a PaaS\n(platform as a service).  During this workshop we learned about the 12 factors that affect web\ndeployment (http://12factor.net).  \n\nWe then built and deployed a web application using the following recipe\n(http://pycon-tutorial.herokuapp.com).  This process can be repeated in less than five minutes.\nHeroku provides a free service that can support a hobby job, but also scales to extremely large\nsystems.  It is not the cheapest service (considering only fees), but probably the cheapest (if you\nvalue your time). This is going to be my main deployment engine moving forward.\n\n**Wiring Django Packages**\n\nThis session dealt with all of the issues of package usage, installation, deployment, and creation.\nI missed most of this session due to the Heroku session.  The notes are at http://bit.ly/WDP2013\n\n**Tools**\n\nGetting working installations of virtualenv, selenium, and heroku was worth the cost of the entire\nconference.  I can go home now...\n\n... but wait there's more.\n \n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\n**pycon - day 3**\n\nThe first two days were tutorial sessions.  The regular conference sessions spanned the next three\ndays.  The conference attendance what 2500 and the largest that the organizers want it to be.  This\nis to have the maximum opportunity to foster the community spirit of \"people helping people\".\n\n**Raspberry Pi**\n\nEben Upton spoke from Cambridge about the need to foster a hacker ethic.  Cambridge has seen a\nconstant erosion in the number of qualified applications to the computer science program.  Eben was\ngiven the task of revitalizing interest in working with computers by producing low-cost hardware\nthat invites students to program.  Today's systems are built for users and discourage programming.\nTheir solution was the Rasperry Pi, a $35 computer board that has enough capability for almost any\nhobbiest project.  The response to the product has exceeded everyone's expectations.  We were all\ngiven a Raspberry Pi and told to build something cool.\n\nThere was also a lot of discussion about ways to work in communities and schools to foster interest\nin computers and programming.  I am very interested in this subject and would like to work with\nothers on doing something in our community.\n\n**Naming of Ducks**\n\nThis talk dealt with the best pracitices for naming functions, classes, and variables within Python\nprograms.  This is even more important in a language that does not enforce the variable types to be\ndesignated as a they are used.\n\n**Exceptions**\n\nBruce Eckel gave a talk on best practices with exception handling in Python.  He discussed how\nexceptions in Python differ for other lanugages like Java and C++.\n\n**Kivy**\n\nKivy is a GUI toolkit that is great for mobile applications.  It supports non-traditional input\ndevices like multi-touch and Leap Motion.  Visit Kivy.org to learn more about using the toolkit for\nyour apps.\n\n**Python 3.3**\n\nWhy do you want to upgrade from 2.7 to 3.3?  There are many small features that can save effort.\nI'm looking at switching my work to Python 3.3.   Now with virtualenv in place it should be fairly\neasy to move forward.\n\n**Five minute to deploy (using PaaS)**\n\nThis talk discussed the different services available for hosting web apps.  It made the argument\nthat for most small shops (without a large IT staff), you need to get the highest possible value\nfrom your service provider.  He then gave a comparison of six different PaaS (Platform as a service)\nproviders. We gave a demo of a deployment on Heroku that took five minutes.\n\n\n\nSee also PyCon,  [[~/pycon/]], BizPortal\n", "user": 3, "title": "Py Con Learn"}}, {"pk": 221, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/TestingStrategy", "text": "* Testing Strategy *                 -*-muse-*-\n\n**Test-Driven Development Process**\nCreate a failing test\nWrite new feature\nEliminate all duplications\n\n**Test Existing Code**\nDecide on area to test\nWrite passing test (qt)\nConfirm breakage\nMove code to unit test\n\n**Build Testing Framework**\nCreate qt, test, and automatic running\nCreate tests in qt\nMove tests into unit test\n\n**Escalation Path**\nPipe all errors into log file\nCheck log file\nMail errors to Mark Seaman using wm_support\n\n\nSee also [[Brain]]\n\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Testing Strategy"}}, {"pk": 222, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/ClusterCmd", "text": "* Cluster Cmd *                 -*-muse-*-\n\nCommand Cluster (cmd-help for commands)\n\ncmd-clone       # Clone a command\ncmd-clusters    # List command clusters\ncmd-count       # Count the number of commands available\ncmd-delete      # Rename command\ncmd-edit        # Edit a command\ncmd-find        # Find a command containing a string\ncmd-help        # List commands for automation\ncmd-idea        # Build a list of ideas for improving automation\ncmd-new         # Create a new command\ncmd-rename      # Rename command\ncmd-search      # Search for text within commands\ncmd-show        # Find a command that is an alias or a shell script\n\n\nSee also CommandClusters\n\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Cluster Cmd"}}, {"pk": 223, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/DjangoDataBase", "text": "* Django Database Tables *                 -*-muse-*-\n\nThere are several essential methods needed for each data type within\nDjango.

If I miss this then\nnothing else matters.  Over the years I have watched so many people that I love lose their way.  Not\neveryone finishes well, but I want to be one of them.\n\nThe secret to finishing well may be to understand what is really at stake.  This produces an\nappreciation of the challenges to truly following God.  \n\nConsider the people that you have known that are over fifty and still following God.  These folks\nare in it to the finish line.  Throughout life there are many opportunities to give up along the\nway.\n\nHave great respect for the people that go the distance.  Spend time with them.  Learn their\nsecrets of longevity.  We all need people to inspire us.  We also need examples to copy.\n\nAt the end of your life, be remembered as a friend of God.  Make this your goal.  Everything else\npails in comparison.  What profit is there if you gain the whole world and lose your soul in the\nprocess.\n\nCommit time to pursuing God and his agenda.  Look for opportunities to grow and deepen in your\nrelationship with him.  Allow the Spirit to speak clearly and act on your best understanding. Say\n'Yes' before you know the question.\n\nRemove the barriers that separate you from following Jesus.  Repent from sin.  Be aware of the role\nthat fear plays in your life.

I ask that you would watch over Josiah and\nSam.  Keep them secure in your plan.  Let them focus on the important issues of life in front of\nthem and help them to understand how to have a sustainable lifestyle.\n\nThank you for what you have done in both of their lives.  Thank you for the blessing that they have\nbecome to Stacie and me. We have been able to see your grace operating within them, to bring them to\nthe point they are at now. We know that you will continue to be faithful to them.\n\nGod, bless and preserve their health. Restore Josiah's broken arm to its full strength. Help Sam to\nfeel better and the baby to grow and thrive.  Bring relief to Josiah from the migraines he struggles\nwith. \n\nProtect them from any financial tragedy from not having insurance. Allow Josiah and Sam to move into\ntheir new home in Loveland, even though Josiah has a broken arm.\n\nHelp Josiah to concentrate enough on his school work to be sucessful.  Give him the ability to pass\nthe prelim assignment so that he can begin serious work on his thesis.\n\nLet the fullness of your love surround them.  Let your plan for their lives be fully accomplished in\nthem. Bring glory to yourself through their lives.  May your kingdom be demonstrated in them.\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**Marriage Improvement** - Jan 2011\n\nStacie and I have a wonderful marriage.  But I am regularly blindsided by the issues that linger\nunresolved for years. We need a way to identify the emotional needs that drive each of us and\nnegotiate how they can be met.  We need a plan for regular work on our marriage.\n\nIt is easy for me to assume that Stacie is just like me.  This is a very flawed assumption based on\nher many similarities.  We still have many areas where our fundamental assumptions  about things are\ndifferent. This could actually be a strength for us, if we learn to honor those differences.\n\nLord show us where to start.  Help us begin a deeper journey to connect with each other.  I want you\nto be at the center of our relationship.  Draw us closer together.\n\nI confess that I consistantly demand my own selfish way and neglect to look at things from Stacie's\nviewpoint.  I often ignore her needs, while carefully guarding and cultivating my own. Grant me both\nthe desire and power to change.\n\nGive us a means of talking about these issues that is constructive and life-giving.  Make us one in\nspirit and purpose.  Cause us to fall in love all over again.\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**Christmas Blues** - Dec 2011\n\nI recently realized that December is a really tough month for me.  Stacie's expectations create a\ngreat deal of anxiety in me.  The natural differences that we have seem to be accentuated during\nthis time of year.  Conflict is at a annual high, during this season of good will.\n\nI don't enjoy the same activities as Stacie, and this creates tension in our relationship.  There\nare high expectations for social activities and conflict over how to spend money.  I always feel\nlike a reluctant participant in these activities. Then I feel guilty for not wanting to take part or\nfor not enjoying it like I should.\n\nI feel bullied and like a second rate person who can't appreciate the true meaning of Christmas.\nStacie frequently compares me to members of my family that I know that she does not respect.  I\ncan't wait for January to get here when I can get back to normal.\n\nIt is strange to have our anniversary at this time of year.  Maybe it is good timing to pause and\nreflect about the true nature of our relationship when we are feeling so raw and exposed.\n\nLord, help me to see this time of year through your eyes.  Help me to embrace the brokenness that I\nfeel rather than simply hide from it.  Help me to be kind and loving even when I don't want to be.\nShow me how to resolve my own personal issues without driving others crazy.\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**Concern for Christine** - Nov 2011\n\nChristine has not developed in her personal life.  She is smart enough, but completely disabled\nemotionally.  It is likely that she will never be able to care for herself or have meaningful\nrelationships with others. She lacks motivation, confidence, and hope for the future.  I have no\nidea how to help her.  Communication about these subjects is completely fruitless and frustrating.\n\nLord give me courage to even look at this area of my life.  I am so frustrated about it that I\nsystematically avoid all thinking about it.  I completely shutdown emotionally because I feel so\nhelpless.\n\nHelp me to see Christine as you see her.  I know that you have placed her in our family on purpose.\nShe plays a role in our lives and we play a role in hers.  Please give me more understanding about\nwhat that role is.\n\nIf I will ever be able to play a part in helping her I must first embrace your presence in this area\nof my life. Transform my heart and mind.  Give me you insights so that I can be changed at the core.\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nSee also PrayerPractices\n", "user": 3, "title": "Prayer Journal"}}, {"pk": 266, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/AnnualTime", "text": "* Annual Time Spent *                 -*-muse-*-\n\n**Next 12 months**\n\nStart by defining the scope of your budget.  One year is a good\ntimeframe to consider.  This works great because you can always\nconsider the end of this budget cycle to be one year from now.\n\n**Discretionary Time**\n\nOf the 24 hours each day you should remove at least 10 for sleeping\nand getting ready.

praised MakeMKV before for its ability to quickly and easily rip DVDs and Blu-ray discs to\n high quality MKV files with a single click. The app has been in beta for a long time (years, in\n fact), which is just as well, since the developers promise to start charging for Blu-ray ripping\n once the app leaves beta. The app's strong suits are that it's fast, super easy, and cross-platform\n (the Linux version is available in the forums.) Plus, the app preserves all of the source disc's\n information, including tracks, chapters, HD audio, menus, and so on. The app is completely free. \n\nHandbrake (Win/OS X/Linux) http://handbrake.fr/\n\nHandbrake is our favorite video encoder for a reason: it's simple, easy to use, easy to install, and\noffers a wealth of tweaking options to get the best possible file as a result. If you're daunted by\nthem, you don't even have to use themthe app will compensate for you and pick some settings it\nthinks you'll like based on your destination device. So many of you like Handbrake that many of you\nuse it in conjunction with another appyou'll let another app do the rip and crack the DRM on your\ndiscs, and then process the file through Handbrake for encoding. The app is fast, can make the most\nof multi-core processors to speed up the process, and is completely open source. Best of all, it's\ncompletely free. \n\n\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "D V D Ripping"}}, {"pk": 291, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/AddressedToGod", "text": "* Addressed To God *                 -*-muse-*-\n\nThis journal is written as a prayer to You.

Distorted**\n\nThis is the first trip to the middle-east for Stacie and me. We are shocked by how little we truly\nunderstand of this region.  The history is very rich, which means that the various conflicts run\nvery deep.\n\nAfter just a few days it became clear that the news that we get in the US is very distorted.  It is\nalways filtered through a strong political agenda. Here, we are able to get a much fuller story from\nboth local residents and Americans that have lived here for decades.\n\nBeyond the politics, we are able to see what God is doing in this area of the world.  He is at work\nin many different ways.  I plan on writing a series of articles to relate experiences that we have\nhad, tell the stories of others, and show you how you can become involved in the work of God's\nkingdom.\n\nStacie and I are currently in Amman, Jordan.  We are meeting with so many wonderful people and want\nto tell their stories.  We hope that these stories prompt you to pray and feel a part of God's work\nhere.\n\n\n**Training Jordanian Pastors**\n\nOn Thursday and Friday a training event was held for Jordanian pastors.  These men are sharing the\ngospel and doing great work around the capital city of Amman.  Jordan has about 6.5 million people\nwith about half of them living in the greater Amman area.  70% of all people are under age 23, 35%\nunder 14.\n\nRick O. spoke about how God is moving in the youth.  This is a vital message for the church in\nAmman. Youth tend to be much more open to change than their parents.  People are actively looking\nfor answers to the difficulties of living life.\n\nA strategy for Rescuing, Reaching, Rooting, Releasing, and Resourcing youth may provide a model for\nhow to establish the church for the next generation.  The demographics of Jordan make this message\nan extremely important one.\n\nIt is an amazing experience to be a part of worship in another culture and language.  Even though we\ncannot understand most of what is spoken we recognize the exuberant praise and worship of our\ncommon savior. \n\n\n**Let's Buy That Mountain**\n\nSometimes our faith is too small and our vision of God's heart is too limited.  When we see others\ntrusting him, then it gives us courage to step out into deeper waters.  \n\nYesterday, I saw an example of faith in action.  We visited a church in Jordan that is really moving\nforward. The church appears to be made up of mostly people under 30. They have a heart for reaching\nout to their city and nation.\n\nThe pastor had a vision for creating a camp for youth and young adults.  He located a piece of\nproperty in the vicinity of Mt. Nebo (the spot where Moses died before the Jews entered the promised\nland).  It is also not far from the location where Jesus was baptized in the Jordan river.\n\nThere is a building and olive trees on the property.  The view is spectacular with mountains and\nsteep ravines immediately on the edge of the property.  We stood on the mountain and tried to\nimagine the giant throngs of people and livestock making there way through this spot down to the\nriver.\n\nIt is exciting to visualize how God will be using this spot to change the lives of so many people.\nThis location reminds me of the importance of acting on what God is leading us to do.  It is easy to\nhear from him and not act on what he says.  But the blessing only come when we step into the\nfullness of his plan.\n\n\n**Responding to the Call to Prayer**\n\nAll over the Islamic world there is a call to prayer five times daily.  This is done through loud\nspeakers in many locations throughout the cities.  To westerners this is a strange practice.\n\nMany people living here comment on how oppressive this feels.  But others use it as a legitimate\nreminder to call out to God for his freedom.  People that see the call to prayer as an invitation,\nend up praying more in the middle-east than at home.\n\nIt is important to have reminders in our lives to act as triggers to pursue God.  What reminders\ncould you use everyday to help you to connect with God on a regular basis?\n\n\n**Jordan has a Key Role in God's Plan**\n\nJordan is an interesting place.  It has very few natural resources, is mostly desert, and has a very\nyoung population.  The country is led by a king, who is very loved by the people.  Jordan is the\nmost stable government in the Arab world.\n\nThe country is mostly populated by people who have migrated from what is now Israel.  Each wave of\npolitical upheaval in Israel results in more immigration to Jordan. This last year, unrest in Syria has\nalso resulted in 200,000 refugees in camps.  Conditions in these camps are extremely difficult.\n\nJordan is viewed by many as a place of refuge.  Jordan has also played a key role of peace in the\nmiddle-east. In exchange for aid from the US, Jordan plays a peace-maker role between the other\ncountries with more extreme views.\n\nThis is a tricky balance.  Pray for continued peace in Jordan so that this area of the world would\nbe open to the gospel.  Ultimately, true and lasting peace can only come from the Lord.  We are\npraying for God's transforming power on both individuals and nations.\n\n\n**Leaders Coming to Christ**\n\nI recently heard a story that I wanted to pass on.  Because of security concerns do not post this\ninformation anywhere.  The names have been changed to protect the innocent.\n\nOne day, a brother in Christ got a phone call from an important Islamic leader.  Ibrahim was a\nlittle worried, when Ahmed asked to meet with him.\n\nWhen they met Ahmed told Ibrahim that he had been reading the bible and had a lot of questions.\nThey discussed the bible for many hours, and Ahmed opened his heart to the love of Christ.  Ahmed\nwas dramatically impacted by Jesus and wanted to be baptized.  \n\nFor an important leader to come to Christ is a huge commitment. This can be a very dangerous\nsituation for all involved. Please be praying for our new brother Ahmed.  Pray for his spiritual\ngrowth and influence within the community.  Pray for wisdom to know what to do next.\n\nGod is on the move!\n\n\n**Fuel Prices Spark Riots**\n\nFuel prices in Jordan skyrocketed last week.  Cooking fuel increased by 35% as government subsidies\nwere dropped.  For about three days there were regular demonstrations all over the country.  Some of\nthe protests turned voilent, but most were calm.\n\nAlmost a week later there were still riot police gathering around the mosques where the\ndemostrations are held.  Last night we saw armoured vehicles with mounted machine guns to keep the\ndemonstrations from getting out of hand.\n\nAmy Hybels is a journalist that attends Oasis.  She posted this report.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Bi8wDuErRU\n\n\n**Partnership is the Key**\n\nHistorically, churches has squabbled and competed with one another.  This is utterly contrary to\nGod's will.  Jesus prayed that we would be one in the same way that he was united with the Father.\nThis is still his desire for us.\n\nAs people have worked in other countries it is common to come in with a superior attitude.  The\ncountries that have a rich heritage of faith assume that they have all of the answers.  This is not\nthe attitude of Christ.\n\nThe gospel in rooted in many places throughout the world.  It is vital that we recognize the work of\nGod in every place we go.  In Jordan, there is a thriving church among the Arab people.  We must\ncome alongside the church and bless them.\n\nWe must come as learners.  Our role, although important, is secondary to the role of the Jordanian\nchurch.  Our primary goal is to bless what God is already doing, and serve the church that is\nalready in place.\n\nThe spirit of partnership, is recognizing that God has given each of us a role within his kingdom.\nEach part of the body can do it's thing and then the entire body is built up and strengthened.  We\nare better together than anyone is alone.\n\nIt is a joy to serve alongside our brothers and sisters around the world.\n\n\n**Difficulty with Daily Life**\n\nI have been struck by how different daily life is here in Jordan.  Things that I simply take for\ngranted are a big deal. \n\nTransportation is the first thing that I noticed.  A trip across town is very simple in the US.  It\ncould easily take an hour to get somewhere.  Cars cost about twice what they would in the US and\ntraffic is wild.  Amman is very spread out.\n\nSometimes, when road construction is done the road is simply blocked off and people drive through\nempty lots to create a new route to where they are going. Since we have been here, there have been\nmany protests, which also block roads.\n\nPeople also put a lot of effort into getting kids to school, doing laundry and getting food, fuel,\nand water.  These things take only minor thought at home, but here, they take a major part of the\nday.\n\nLife here seams to run about an hour later than what is scheduled and last about an hour\nlonger. There is a certain level of appeal to this more relaxed pace, but it requires a conscious\nadjustment for us westerners.\n\nStrong schedules with many events planned can be a source of frustration for many Americans\nhere. Hospitality takes precedence over timeliness.  Maybe we can learn something from them.\n\n\n**The Hope of the Gospel**\n\nI look to the mountains.  Where does my help come from?  This world is seriously broken.  Being in a\ndifferent culture reveals new ways that we are broken.\n\nAll of humanity operates under the curse of sin.  Ethnic hatred, prejudice, murder, abuse, slavery,\ncorruption, and poverty are simply symptoms of this curse.  As we are willing to see, we can feel\noverwhelmed. \n\nWhere do we start to fix our world?  How can we make a difference?  Is our hope is better\ngovernment? Do we really believe that if our party wins then the world will become a magical place\nof sparkling lights?\n\nOur only hope for the world, is that God would transform peoples hearts. We must start with our own\nhearts. As my heart is transformed by the presence of God, he gives me eyes to see what he is\ndoing. \n\nFixing the world is a God-sized problem, not a man-sized one.  On our own we can do nothing. But God\ncan transform a community, nation, and world.  He invites us to be used in specific ways.  But\nultimately, he is the one that does the work.\n\nJesus invites us as his bride to work in partnership. He directs, but we respond.  He empowers, but\nwe obey.  Together we make the world a better place, not though human effort alone. But in\npartnership with the Spirit of God, we will move back the darkness.\n\n\n<------------  posted \n\n\n**Bible Training Camp**\n\nOne of the pastors in Jordan came up with a idea to train people in the bible.  It is often\ndifficult and often dangerous for people to study the bible when in their home town.  Family members\nand others in the community usually opposed to the the bible.  This can often result in violent\nretaliation for both the student and the teacher.\n\nThis pastor found that by getting people out of the country that they were much more open to the\nLord.  He has created a bible study retreat in a different country.  It is like an emersion class in\nbible study and prayer.\n\nThis has been a very effective strategy and has changed the lives of many people.  It is wonderful\nto see how different people are responding to God's call and willing to take large risks for the gospel.\n\n\n**Headlines**\n\nBuilding Bridges, Not Walls\n\nOne Person Can Make a Difference\n\nCourage to Act\n\n**Heart for All People**\n\nSelf-interest is Not Enough\n\n**Source of All Conflict**\n\n**Prince of Peace**\n\n**Blood Brothers**\n\n\nSee also JordanTrip\n", "user": 3, "title": "Jordan Stories"}}, {"pk": 307, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/WmGitRepos", "text": "* Wm Git Repos *                 -*-muse-*-\nJan 2, 2013 -- Reset the server repos for Watermill\n\n**Motivation**\nMatch the use of git repos to the actual problem.

It is used to get and set live\ndata values on a running mill.\n\nMill Probe is a tool that can be used from a remote computer to interrogate a watermill.  This\ncreates a remote access for the 'millcmd' data in a watermill.\n\nMill Probes only support getting the data values for security reasons.\n\n\nHow does it work?\n\nThe mill probe system is made up of several different components that work together.  Each part of\nthe system is very simple, but together the system is quite sophisticated.  The components are:\n\n * Mill Probe Server\n * Mill Probe Script\n * Probe Command\n * Mill Command\n * Node.JS\n * Probe HTML\n\n\nMill Probe Server\n\nThis application runs on each watermill.  It provides a web service interface to answer queries.  It\nuses a URL to request that a particular Mill Probe Script be run on the watermill.  \n\nExample:\n    http://65.121.123.216:3002/pressure\n    This url requests that the pressure script be run on the watermill located at 65.121.123.216.\n    The results are gathered and returned as a web response.\n\n\nMill Probe Script\n\nOn each watermill there are scripts that contain a list of millcmd variables.  Each script is a mill\nprobe.  Each script can be invoked by executing it on the remote watermill.\n\nExample:\n    sc-milldo 3006 'millcmd probe/pressure'\n\n\nProbe Command\n\nOn the watermill support servers (production, staging, development) a probe command can be\nexecuted. This command when find the appropriate probe to be executed on the requested unit.  This\nis based on the software version running on the requested unit.\n\nThe probe command is executed remotely by sending the correct web request to the Mill Probe Server\non the watermill.  The results are then returned as a text file to the caller.\n\nExample:\n    sc-probe 3006 pressure\n\n\nMill Command\n\nThis command lives on the watermill.  It does the actual variable lookup on the live mill.  Results\nare returned as text.\n\nExample:\n    millcmd presssure.mc\n\n\nNode.JS\n\nThe Mill Probe Server is a lightweight web server that is built using a server-side JavaScript\nlibrary, called Node.JS.  This is an extremely efficient way to create a web server that does\nsomething simple.  Each watermill must have Node.JS installed.\n\nExample:\n    apt-get install nodejs\n\n\nProbe Definition\n\nEach probe is defined by a list of variables for millcmd and labels to show them in english.  When\nexecuted on a watermill each value is read from the Mill Probe Server.  Then the value is formatted\nby the matching string to display it in a friendly way.\n\nExample:\n    label_map = {\n        'production.tankLevel.state.fillNeeded' : 'Tank level state fill needed %s',\n        'production.tankLevel.state.floatSwitchState' : 'Tank level float switch %s',\n    }\n\n\nProbe HTML\n\nEach probe returns a block of text when executed.  This results in a nicely formatted list of data\nvalues that are obtained from a running mill.  This text is then wrapped in the '< pre >' tag to\npreserve the spacing.\n\nExample:\n    < pre >\n        Tank level state fill needed 42\n        Tank level float switch 1\n    < /pre >\n\n\nBuilding a new probe\n\nProbes are created on the server.  A new probe requires a name, a unit number, and a variable string\npattern to use in millcmd.  The existing file will not be overwritten to eliminate accidents.  The\nprobe will be created for the software version matching the unit.\n\nOnce a Probe Definition is create it can be manually edited to present the data value in a friendly\nway. \n\nExample:\n    sc probe-make 3006 pressure state.pressure\n    This creates a Probe Definition (probes/pressure-5.9.probe)\n    \n\nManaging software versions\n\nProbes are all tied to minor versions of software.  For example, 7.0.4 and 7.0.6 are both minor\nversion 7.0.\n\nWhen working with a probe the system will automatically match the probe version to the unit\nversion.  A lookup table is Support Center allow you to avoid doing this mapping manually.\n\nExample:\n    sc probe-exec 3006 pressure\n    Execute the probe 'probes/pressure-5.9.probe' on unit 3006\n", "user": 3, "title": "Mill Probe"}}, {"pk": 310, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/Commands", "text": "* Commands *                 -*-muse-*-\n\nMost important commands\n\naction      todo        work            dates\n\nplan        eplan\n\nmybook      mb-edit     mb-publish      mb-web\n\nbrain       be          bn              bs\n\nthump       hammer      jack            nhammer\n\nproject     pdoc        todo            run             web\n\n\n\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Commands"}}, {"pk": 311, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/HTML5", "text": "* HTML 5 *                 -*-muse-*-\n\nhttp:corehtml5canvas.com\nGoogle presentation program -

This reduces the overall risk to the client by allowing the project to meet the minimum\nfunctionality and then stop. Most project have a large amount of unknown factors that make it very\ndifficult to set scope at the beginning.\n\nA project can produce a steady stream of results to the client.  This will allow you to set the\nagenda for what gets developed next, and make any necessary changes.  You can guide the project\nthroughout rather than commit to all of the features upfront.\n\nShrinking World Solutions recommends this form of pricing for most projects.  It is the most\nflexible way to produce the quickest and cheapest result.  Hourly rates are established by the skill\nlevel of the person doing the task (typically between $50 - $135).\n\n\n**Fixed Pricing**\n\nThis model can work well for projects that are fully understood at the outset.  This is often the\ncase when replacing an existing system with new technology.  Under this model each piece of\nfunctionality is built into the price.  A price list is used to set the price of the overall\nproject.\n\nFollowing is a sample price list.  This is used for illustration only since the details for each\nproject vary greatly.\n\n * Gathering requirements & design work  (these both scale with the project and are priced into the\n   other parts of the model)\n * Testing is built in to the development time\n * Final acceptance testing is done by the client\n * Setup web hosting and deployment (typical web hosting is inexpensive)\n\n * Data types (eg. customers, order, part numbers)          $1000/type\n * Web views (eg. add customer, list orders)                $500/view\n * Data import/export formats (eg. send/receive orders)     $1000/file type\n * Security (eg. customer logins, SSL, SSH)                 $1000/feature\n\n\n\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Pricing Web Development"}}, {"pk": 316, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/CelebrateAccomplishments", "text": "* Celebrate Accomplishments *                 -*-muse-*-\n\nEach person has several talent themes that can be both a strength and a weakness.  These are\ndiscribed in detail in \"Strength's Finder 2.0\".  One of the talent themes is called Achiever.  This\ncompells a person to accomplish great things with a high energy level.\n\nBut it can also give people a value of self-worth that is determined by what they have accomplished\nin the last day.  One of the significant weaknesses of the Achiever talent is that it is difficult\nto sense satisfaction in acheivements.  The thrill disipates very quickly.\n\nThis makes it essential for people with Achiever to find ways to extend the enjoyment for past\naccomplishments. One practice that I have found helpful is to celebrate the successes. If there is\nnot a conscious pratice of celebration, then the Achiever will naturally be drawn into a despondency\nover what was not done.\n\nI find it all but impossible to enjoy the accomplishments of the past while still dealing with the\nchallenges of the future.  New goals quickly eclipse old ones.  Past deeds are immediately replaced\nby new unmet demands.  Celebration can break this downward spiral.\n\nThis form of celebration has several distinct parts:\n\n**recall** - make a list of everything that was done, or was was learned along the way\n\n**organize** - group things together into themes and extract the key learning\n\n**dream** - about where you would like to take this accomplishment in the future\n\n**share** - your ideas with others that can appreciate what you did\n\n**prioritize** - assess how important this accomplishment is relative to other possible investments\n\nConsider doing this type of activity, monthly, quarterly, and yearly.  This will energize other\nactivities you do.  You might set aside a whole day once a quarter to review your past achievements\nand plan new ones.  Celebration should play a central role in this type of planning.\n\nSee also PersonalRetreat\n\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Celebrate Accomplishments"}}, {"pk": 317, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/TrustRamp", "text": "* Trust Ramp *                 -*-muse-*-\nThe trust ramp is a model for how relationships form over time.\n\n**Applies to every type of relationship**\nMarriage, Kids, Clients, Colleagues, Friends\nBuilt into our psyche\nDefines the operation of relationships\n\n**Starts at zero**\nNo initial data on which to assume trust\nMust start small\nFulfilled expectations built more trust\nDisappointments can reset it\nInternal tug-of-war\n\n**The next step is proportional to the level gained**\nWith low trust, low risk is warranted\nHigh trust allows for high risk\nRelationships can be managed to build more trust\nThere is an optimal rate to progress\n\n**Trust can be measured**\nWhat is the most risk that someone would be willing to take?\nMatch opportunities with history\nDesign the ramp\nAlways have the next step planned\n\nSee also [[Business]]\n\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Trust Ramp"}}, {"pk": 318, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/Activities", "text": "Activities                  -*-muse-*-\n    Work\n        Write\n            Publish content\n            Write new articles\n            Plan projects\n        Career\n            Business networking\n            Planning\n            Public presence\n            Business practices\n        Admin\n            HOA\n            Pay bills\n            Long-term planning\n            Household projects\n        Computer\n            Automation\n            My Book\n            Programming\n            Tools\n    Grow\n        Spiritual\n            Experience God\n            Spiritual review\n            Write on spiritual topics\n            Tim\n        Learn\n            Agenda\n            Brain\n            Web sites\n            Technology\n        Plan\n            Weekly review\n            My story\n            Monthly objectives\n        Practices\n            Document best practices\n            List problem areas\n            Publish ideas\n    People\n        Family\n            Stacie\n            Christine\n            Josiah & Sam\n            Rachel\n        Church\n            Sunday\n            Home group\n            Breakfast\n            Tech team\n        Blog\n            Write articles\n            Edit and publish\n            New topics to write about\n        Social\n            Relational map\n            Dinner out\n            Social networking\n    Fun\n        Entertainment\n            Movies out\n            Movies in\n            TV\n            Agenda of things to watch\n        Reading\n            Fun books\n            Comics\n            EW\n        Music\n            Digitize music\n            Buy music\n            Enjoy music\n            Learn about musicians\n        Internet\n            You Tube\n            Wander the internet\n            Discover something new \n            Read a popular blog article\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Activities"}}, {"pk": 319, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/StacieNeeds", "text": "* Stacie Needs *                 -*-muse-*-\n\n*What Stacie needs from her lover*\n\nThese are the things that are her top emotional needs.

What gets fed grows, so it is time to feed the\nspirit. I don't feel that much time has been given to the things of the spirit over the last couple\nof years. It is time for a change.\n\nThis journal follows a few simple rules, AbsoluteHonesty is required to produce anything of\nvalue. The journal is AddressedToGod and could be used as a prayer. I intend to update this journal\nas part of a program for improving my OngoingHabits.\n\nI am desiring to pursue You more diligently and consistently on a daily basis. Keeping a spiritual\njournal is a key part of my life with You. It causes me to have an increased awareness and focus on\nwhat You are doing within me and the issues that are driving my thoughts.\n\nI have shared this commitment to journaling with Stacie, Dick Spitler, and Bruce Hoppe. This will\nprovide some accountability for me for additional motivation.\n\nMy plan is to write something every day in this journal. It doesn't have to be a lot, but it must be\nsomething. For the next 40 days I will record my progress each day and restart if I miss a day. At\nthen end of that time I will celebrate my new habit of journaling.\n\n\n**Daily Needs**\n\nEach day depends on Your provision and blessing. It is so hard to comprehend or remember that\ntruth. In my daily striving it is so easy to think that everything depends on me. I ask You to give\nme the things that I need for today. Give me wisdom to know how this day should be spent.\n\nBeing a two-cracker guy I want to store up manna for the future, instead of trusting You to provide\nfor tomorrow as well as You do today. Help me to focus my attentions on the things that are needed\ntoday rather than borrow trouble from tomorrow.\n\nIt is so wonderful to see how GodProvides. ThankYou for all of Your blessings. But I want our\nrelationship to move BeyondBlessings.  \n\n\n**In The Present**\n\nHelp me to meet with You in the present. That is the best place where I can experience Your\npresence. I can recieve Your mercy, Your peace, Your guidance, Your correction, and Your power\nworking in me.\n\nEach moment I can reach out and touch You. I can call out to You. I can surrender my will to You,\nbut only in the present. Recalling a time when we were close is meaningless if my heart is rebelling\nnow. Anticipating a time when I will lay it all down is false if right now I refuse to yield.\n\nMy will operates in the now. I choose to yield or wrest control only now. The past and the future\ndon't really matter when it comes to meeting with You. Help me to see my life as a series of\nindividual moments that might be spent with You, rather than wasted on self indulgence.\n\nNow is the time when I can depend on You for my DailyNeeds. Now is the time when I can ThankYou for\nwhat You have done.\n\n\n**By Your Grace**\n\nI am amazed how hard it is for me to remain aware that it is all about You. I so easily revert to\nbelieving that somehow I am responsible for carrying this relationship forward. Yet when I look deep\nin my heart it is clear that there is nothing good that You did not put there.\n\nThank You for wooing me to You. Thank You for choosing me to follow You. Thank You for transforming\nmy heart. Thank You for the further transformation that is yet to take place. Thank You for the\nultimate destination of eternity with You.\n\nWithout Your power working in my life there is still no hope for me. It is not as if You have fixed\nme and now I can take it from here. I am more accurately in a constant state of spiritual brokenness\nand You are all that stands between me and the abyss.\n\n\n**Daily Habits**\n\nRick Warren described nine habits to make us more loving\n\nPhysical Habits\n    Rest\n    Exercise\n    Diet\n\nEmotional Habits\n    Recreation\n    Laughter\n    Helping others\n\nSpiritual Habits\n    Solitude\n    Service\n    Denying yourself\n\n\n**Quiet Time Activities**\n\nThere are a number of essential activities that replensih the spirit. These enhance life and must be done regularly.\n\n    Worship\n    Thanksgiving\n    Acknowledge my fears\n    Forgive others\n    Reflect on what is going well\n    Explore changes\n    Read scripture\n    Prayer journal\n    Read inspirational book\n    Read training book\n    Read blogs\n    Imagine three years from now\n    Plan a good deed\n    Weekly review and planning\n    Analyze a big problem\n    Review the last 90 days\n    Reflect on recent learning\n    Make a list of books to read\n    Identify great sources of joy\n    Write my life story\n    Examine last year\n    Write in journal\n\n\n**My Dream Job** - These are based on my Work Values\n\nFollowing are my characteristics for a dream job.\n\n    I use my strengths every day\n    My clients appreciate my expertise\n    I earn a high wage per hour worked\n    90% of the total work time is billable\n    There is a feeling of teamwork and respect\n    I am making an important contribution each day\n    I am paid to learn new things\n    The work location is flexible allowing me to work part of the time at home\n    I can get work when I need it\n    Clients trust my judgment\n    I have flexibility to take time off\n    Selling is not the main focus of the job\n    I am able to establish ongoing relationships with clients\n    I trust my clients\n    I can see a way to be successful\n    Creativity is required to solve new problems\n    I learn and share best practices\n    I organize tasks within a project\n    The client desires agility\n    Minimal time is spent on people issues\n    Efficiency and effectiveness are important\n    My expertise is unique\n\n\n**Pray For Work**\n\nYour word tells us DontWorry and yet I often worry when I should pray instead. You know the\nimportance of work in my life. Even though I am currently employed there is a degree of uncertainty\nassociated with it.\n\nToday I found myself concerned that I would not be able to keep steady work coming. One prospect\nthat was a significant hope appears less so now. An existing client is struggling to pay me for\nprevious work. It is easy to fixate on the circumstance rather than the provider.\n\nLord, You have always given us so much more than we have ever needed. Thank You for Your constant\ncare for us. I know that You will be there for us no matter what situations we face. Thanks for Your\npeace.\n\n\n**Ideal Work**\n\nOptimize the following attributes\n\n    Low stress - 1 problem sleeping / month\n    Invested time - 50 hours / week\n    Total income - $/hour invested\n    Value produced - Billable rate $70\n\n\n**Embracing Brokenness**\n\nI try so hard to be self sufficient and in complete control. But true dependence on You requires\nthat I get to the end of my resources. As long as I can create the life that I want without You then\nI am not really trusting You.\n\nWhen I finally have arrived at the end of my own abilities then You are there to meet me. You are\nmore interested in relationship than my comfort. Brokenness is the place where I completely\nsurrender to You.\n\nBrokenness is where I discover Your plan and purpose for me. Because I have given up on my dreams\nYou are able to give me new ones. Not only is the goal different, but the means are also changed. I\ntrade self-sufficiency for Your power.\n\nBrokenness is the state where I realize that You are God and I am not. It is when I become teachable\nand moldable. Until I have been broken I can not serve Your purpose.\n\nBrokenness replaces self-delusion with truth. It makes me acknowledge what has always been true -\nthat You are in control.\n\nAt the Iron Men's breakfast my answer came. Jerry White spoke about facing loss. He said that every\nman will face 5 types of loss. Men will lose identity, influence, position, motivation, and\nsecurity.\n\nHe described my situation. We all experience this loss ,but we are always surprised by it.\n\nI recognized that You had put me in this situation for His purpose. It was no accident. You were\ndoing something inside of me that would make the discomfort worth it.\n\nThat changed my perception of the whole situation. It was no longer about the reasons for the\nissues. I needed to understand what You were desiring to do within me.\n\nI try everything in our power to fix the situation. Sometimes it is the very situation that You are\nusing to fix me.\n\nBrokenness is an emotional state where we embrace truth.\nSelf sufficiency keeps us from discovering the truth.\nIn brokenness we find truth.\n\nIn our need we find a provider.\nIn our illness we find a healer.\nIn our despair we find a savior.\n\nWe want the provider, healer, and savior. We just don't want to be in a state where we need it.\n\n\n**Fear Itself**\n\nIf left to our own nature we will be consumed by fear. There are many bad things that could happen\nto us. It is tempting to engage in fantasies about how bleak the future could be.\n\nHope is creating a positive fantasy of the future. Some people are by nature more hopeful. The real\nbasis of all our hope is You, God. If You control the shape of our lives and direct its course then\nwe can trust You completely with the future.\n\nHelp me to have this sense of security and peace about the future. I am tired of living in\nfear. Show me how I can live a life of complete faith in You.\n\n\n**So Much Pain**\n\nThis world is filled with pain. There are so many things that are out of control due to the fallen\nnature of this world. Every person faces a series of struggles to make something good out of our\nlives. It often seems that the human drama is this struggle itself. How do we survive and even\nthrive in world broken by sin?\n\nTeach me how to depend on You for everything. Show me how to serve others and give them hope.\n\n\n**Beyond Blessings**\n\nIt is true that You give us everything that we need. But I don't want that to be the\nsole basis of our relationship together. I know that You don't want that either. Forgive me for\nseeking Your blessings and not Your intimacy.\n\nI want to be Your friend and Your son, not just legally, but in practical reality. I want my daily\nreality, and choices to be determined by You. I desire to live my life in Your presence as an act of\nworship.\n\n**Connecting With People**\n\nWhen I think about communicating with people, I am consumed with my role in the relationship. This\ntakes two forms: what can I get from them, and what should I communicate. This is all wrong and\ntwisted. It means that every relationship is about me.\n\nLord, help me to see as valuable and interesting in their own right, rather than means to achieve my\nself-centered goals. Give me an attitude of service toward others. Show me ways that I can serve\nwithout expecting repayment of any kind.\n\nI am so ashamed of my selfishness. Help me to change. Give me Your attitude for people.\n\n\n**My Fears**\n\nThese are my greatest fears:\n\n    rejection\n    exposure\n    ridicule\n    insignificance\n    lack of resources\n    injury\n    sickness\n    pain\n    death\n    loss of sexuality\n    loss of faith\n    loss of identity\n    loss of security\n    loss of control\n    being alone\n    loss of a loved one\n    hopelessness\n    loss of position\n    loss of influence\n    lost motivation\n\nFear is such a powerful influence in life. Lord help me to allow You into my fears. Give me the\nstrength to surrender even the darkest fears to You.\n\n\n**My Plan Vs Gods**\n\nI love to create plans. This is my way of establishing control. These plans are often in conflict\nwith Your plan and purpose for me.\n\nYou see the beginning from the end. While my view is incredibly limited, Your's is not. You really\ndo know what is best.\n\nOver the past year I have learned more about how dependent I am on You. Without You I can't do\nanything. Help me, Lord, to embrace Your presence daily.\n\nThe Lord directs our steps, so why try to understand everything along the way?\n\n\nSee also  AddressedToGod,  AbsoluteHonesty, OngoingHabits, LifeCycle\n\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Spiritual Journal"}}, {"pk": 329, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/Python", "text": "* Python *                 -*-muse-*-\n\n*Most effective scripting language*\n\nLearning python\n\nSetup environment\n    Installation\n    Path settings\n    Executing scripts\n\nLanguage constructs\n    Functions\n    Lists and dictionaries\n    Packages\n\nBuilding utilities\n    ...\n\n...\n\nSee also [[Tools]]\n\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Python"}}, {"pk": 330, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/Hobbies", "text": "* Hobbies *                 -*-muse-*-\n\n\nSee also [[Reading]], [[Music]], [[Photography]], [[Internet]], [[Movies]], [[TV]], [[Travel]], [[Brain]],\n", "user": 3, "title": "Hobbies"}}, {"pk": 331, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/MaturityMarkers", "text": "* Maturity Markers *                 -*-muse-*-\n\nmaturity markers (becoming more Christ-like)\n\n    my life is ... characterized by ...\n    content     (inner peace)\n    simple      (core values) \n    generous    (outward focus) \n    loving      (forgive)\n\nSee also PrayerPractices\n\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Maturity Markers"}}, {"pk": 332, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/TerminalProfiles", "text": "* Terminal Profiles *                 -*-muse-*-\n\nCreate two custom terminal profiles for gnome-terminal.\n\nSelect Terminal, Profiles, New\n\n**Target**\nTitle = Target\nRun a command instead of shell:  /tmp/target\nColors: Black on yellow\n\n**Build**\nTitle = Build\nRun a command instead of shell:  /home/seaman/wme/application-git/scripts/chroot-start\nColors: Black on yellow\n\ntest with 't mill@$wms', 'bldwin'\n\n\nSee also ComputerSetup\n\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Terminal Profiles"}}, {"pk": 333, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/Productivity", "text": "* Productivity *                 -*-muse-*-\n\nPrinciples to maximize value\n    Work on the highest priority\n        Have a map of projects\n        Sort in order of priority\n        Capture new actions with actions from projects\n        Work off of the action list\n    Collaborate\n        Review priorities with others weekly\n        Communicate accomplishments weekly with demos\n        Clarify issues immediately\n        Take feedback seriously\n    Fix problems early\n        Don't allow problems to grow\n        Prioritize problems high\n        Test everything; assume nothing works properly\n        Build incrementally in small steps\n    Build better tools\n        Automate everything possible\n        Maintain tools\n        Eliminate repetition everywhere\n        Never rely on your brain for memory\n\nSee also AnalysisJournal\n\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Productivity"}}, {"pk": 334, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/ProductivityCommandments", "text": "* Productivity Commandments *                 -*-muse-*-\n\nThese commands are given that ye may prosper.\n\n1.

But it is also a personal letter\ndelivered by the Holy Spirit to me in December 2011.  The words are different but the message is\ntrue to the original.\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nDear Mark,\n\nWhen I think of you I feel real joy.  I started the work in you and will finish it.  My presence and\nprovision is with you, even in suffering and pain.\n\nI want for your life to overflow with love.  I desire for you to keep growing in knowledge and\nunderstanding.  You need to understand what really matters in order to live in purity, waiting for\nme.\n\nI saved you initially and will produce my character in you.  This process glorifies me and is what I\nintended from the start.\n\nYou can be confident that both your life and death will bring me honor. You live for me, but dying\nis an even better deal for you.\n\nYour life is about helping others grow to understand the joy of trusting me.  My presence in your\nlife will give you even more confidence in me.\n\nLiving like true citizens of my kingdom honors me.  Keep on living for what really matters, even\nwhen others are not there to encourage you.  I will restore everything, so don't be intimidated by\nanything. \n\nI have started a profound work in you.  I gave you hope and a sense of belonging.  My love brings\nyou peace and comfort and my Spirit brings you unity with other believers.  I have planted love and\ncompassion deep within you.\n\nContinue this unity by wholeheartedly agreeing with others, fully loving them, and working well\ntogether.  Don't be selfish or try to impress others.  Both of these are rooted in pride.  Be\nhumble, thinking of others as more important. Put the interests of others before your own.\n\nHave my attitude about others. I was willing to deny my own deity.  Instead I gave up my divine\nglory and became a human slave.  I was executed as a lowly and despised criminal.\n\nAs a result I now have the highest reputation possible.  I am the rightful object of worship for\neverything living on earth and beyond.  I am absolute Lord of all creation.  All glory everywhere\nbelongs to me.\n\nYou should reflect this glory in your daily life.  You have started well, but continue on with\nobedience and passion for me.  For I am working in you, giving you both the desire and power to do\nwhat pleases me.\n\nDo everything without complaining or arguing, to silence your critics.  Become a peacemaker with\nchild-like innocence. Shine like lights in a dark, nasty, and corrupt world.  \n\nCling to my promises.  Then you will finish well and my full work will be accomplished in you.\n\nYour life may end up being a simple act of sacrifice to me. But worship is ultimately an end in\nitself.  Every act of worship brings glory that I deserve.\n\nShare in the joy of authentic worship.  Don't miss out.  Joy is best when shared.\n\nI bring people into your life to encourage and strengthen you.  You will be surrounded by those who\ncare nothing for my leadership.  But there will always be a few, that are like moms and dads to you.\n\nSome people have demonstrated their quality through their constant acts of service and love.  You\nshould treasure these relationships and spend time with them.\n\nAs you follow me you, will grow closer to other believers. You will long for more opportunities to\nspend time together.  Your destinies will be joined together in both joy and sorrow. I am leading\nyou both, so all your relationships are a key part of my plan for your life.\n\nNo matter what happens, true joy is found in me.  I provide consistent instruction to keep you on\nthe right path.  Try to stay on my path, so that my plans can develop fully within you.\n\nBeware of evil people who wear religious masks.  My true followers have no confidence in human\neffort, even when you feel justified by your own accomplishments.  You have good reason to trust in\nyour own performance if anyone does.\n\nYou have led a successful, orderly, and law-abiding life.  You have raised a great family, been\nactive in the church, and truly pursued my purpose for your life.  You have sacrificed for those you\nlove and tried to be good your entire life.\n\nYou once thought these things were valuable, but now you see that they are worthless in view of my\nlove.  In fact, nothing holds its value next to the infinite value of knowing me.\n\nSo, for my sake, discard everything else like garbage.  Do this in order to become one with\nme. Don't depend on your own ability to be good or follow rules, but follow me with simple yet\nunwavering trust.\n\nYou become pure by trusting in me, nothing else. Long to know me and the power that brought me back\nfrom death.  Choose to suffer with me, so that you too can experience my dramatic resurrection power\nworking in you.\n\nYou have not already achieved these things or reached perfection. But keep pressing on toward the\nplace that I am taking you.  This is the ultimate destination that I have planned for you always.\n\nForget what is already behind you. Focus on the one thing that truly counts. Forget the past\nfailures and pain and look forward to what lies ahead. Press on to reach the end of the race.\nRemember the prize that is waiting at the finish line of this life, me and my kingdom fully in you.\n\nSee also [[Prayer]]\n", "user": 3, "title": "Letter From Jesus"}}, {"pk": 382, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/LifestyleOfChange", "text": "* Lifestyle Of Change *                 -*-muse-*-\n\nChanges in ...\n    thinking\n        * Daily habit of writing\n        * Adopt a growth-mindset\n        * Two hours of admin weekly\n        * Make strategic commitments\n        * Remove clutter (1/2 hour/week)\n        * Find internet gems for learning\n    relationship\n        * Become a mentor\n        * Create life-long friendship\n        * Help Christine get established\n        * Embrace social networking\n        * Strategic services in the Vineyard\n    career\n        * Build Shrinking World Guide\n        * Optimize working conditions\n        * Build six-month financial buffer\n        * Learn emerging technologies\n\nEmbrace lifestyle of change\n    Adjust attitude toward change\n        Change happens to everyone\n        Select the drivers seat\n        Move toward your goals\n        Lens of opportunity\n    Select a single change\n        Make a list\n        Pick the top three\n        Select your next target\n        Narrow the goal\n    Plan your strategy\n        Direct the change (rational self)\n        Provide motivation (emotional self)\n        Stack the deck (change your evironment)\n        Lean on others\n    Rinse and repeat\n        What is bugging you?\n        Small changes with leverage\n        Milestones\n        Follow passion\n\nSee also AnalysisJournal, [[Plan]]\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Lifestyle Of Change"}}, {"pk": 383, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/TomboyNotes", "text": "* Tomboy Notes *                 -*-muse-*-\n*How to incorporate Tomboy notes into my workflow*\n\nBuild a short term memory system\nDaily scratchpad\nMove content to the brain for long term searching and organization\nDynamic wiki links\n\n\nSee also [[Tools]]\n\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Tomboy Notes"}}, {"pk": 384, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/PrayerIdeas", "text": "* Prayer Ideas *                 -*-muse-*-\n\nListen for promptings of the Spirit.

It brings social media to\neveryone without the junkie frivolity of FaceBook or the austere\nrestrictions of LinkedIn.\n\nUnlike FaceBook, you can control which messages go to which circles of\npeople that you know.

Almost no\none communicates there.  It seems to be mostly a place to post your\nresume so that people can see what you are doing.  \n\nThe primary limitation of both LinkedIn and FaceBook is that you can\nnot segment the groups of people to interact with them.  In essence,\nevery conversation that you have is a wildly public conversation.\nMany people are overwhelmed by a lot of discussions that they have no\ninterest in.\n\nEnter Google+.  Imagine going through your contacts and dividing them\ninto groups based on which conversation topics they are interested\nin.  Then create a social networking system around that.\n\nIt sounds like a lot of work, but Google+ has made it very easy.  This\nis a system that is optimized for slapping together a group anytime\nyou want.\n\nIn addition, there are excellent mobile phone applications, and the web\nbrowser works fine as well.

The company\nspecializes in providing low cost, reliable hosting for Django applications.  Mike Hegdal setup the\nbusiness arrangement with Web Faction.   Login information can be obtained by contacting Mike.\n\nWe currently have two separate shared hosting accounts. The same server contains many user accounts.\n * wmexpress2@wmexpress2.webfactional.com - staging server\n * wmexpress@wmexpress.webfactional.com   - production server\n\nThe web site, database, and domain mappings are set up using a Web Faction control panel at\nhttps://my.webfaction.com .\n\nThe web site is visible at  http://wmexpress.webfactional.com.\n\n\n**Support Git**\n\nThe full contents of the web server are contained in version control.  Git repositories contain all\nversions of all files needed to fully reconstruct the entire history of the project.\n\nEach day all files are committed into the repository. Email is sent to the engineering staff for all\nfiles that are not committed. This makes us aware of everything that is happening automatically in\nthe system.\n\n\n**Server Setup Scripts**\n\nAll setup operations are controlled by a set of scripts.  Each script tends to be simple around five\nlines of bash script.  The script performs a single function.  The complex system can be quickly\ndecomposed into a set of simple building blocks for testing and trouble shooting.\n\n\n**Accounting**\n\nThe accounting data in the system is one of the most important aspects of the Support Server.  Each\nnight every mill must send a daily report to Support Server.  Each report is entered into the\ndatabase in the web application, named 'Support Center'.\n\nThese files are also archived as text files in Support Server directories.  This allows us to\ncompletely reconstruct the data that is currently in the database from the raw mill reports.  This\nis occasionally done when a problem is discovered with the web application.\n\n** Chapter 2 - Setup Hosting **\n\n**Account setup**\n\nThe staging and production servers are set up in two separate accounts at Web Faction. Access to\nthese accounts is done through ssh (secure shell).  This lets every operation be fully scripted to\nproduce the same results every time.\n\n\n**Watermill Inbox**\n\n We will need to set up a third account as an inbox that all of the mills can log into.   Each mill\n will contain a key that will allow them to authenicate themselve to the Watermill Inbox.  The inbox\n account will not allow any access to the Support Server.   Instead Support Server will reach in and\n grab files from this location.\n\n\n**Application setup**\n\nThe web application is written in Python.  It uses a web application framework called Django. The\napplication runs in the Apache web server.  The application uses a MySQL database to hold all of the\ndata tables.\n\n\n**Version control**\n\nAll of the application is stored in a Git repository.  A bare repository offers an endpoint for\npush and pull operations. This repository is housed at ssh://65.121.123.211/usr/local/support-git .\n\nThe database is saved each night as a SQL file.  This file is committed into the repository.  This\nwould let us track the history if it were to be important.\n\nAll data files (both input and output) are also committed into this repository.\n\n\n**Automated scripting**\n\nAll deployment is done with a single command from a development machine.  'sc-deploy' is used to\npush the current code to the staging server.   'sc-promote' is used to move the code from the\nstaging server to the production server.\n\nAll testing is performed daily by the script, 'sc-test'.   This runs a directory of scripts and\nsends email containing any unexpected results.\n\nNew problems discovered in the system should be fixed by extending the scripts to detect that\nparticular failure.  This means that over time every problem will be detected quickly and most\nproblems can be fixed automatically.\n\n\n** Chapter 3 - Application Logic\n\n**Mills, users, regions**\n\nThe Support Center web application is built to take care of watermills.  Each mill record defines\ninformation that is important for that mill.   The watermills are broken down by business needs into\nmarkets. \n\nEvery user in Support Center is assigned into a market.  Some users are assigned to the market\n\"none\" and others to \"all\".  Users in Support Center can only see field mills within their market.\nAll other mill data is hidden.\n\n\n**Alert processing**\n\nWhen a mill is malfunctioning it sends an Alert to Support Server.  This is a file containing the\nrecent history of bad things that happened.\n\nEach mill is assigned to a market.  Each user within that market can sign up to listen to all of the\nalerts for the mills in their market.\n\nAs each alert is processed within the Support Center application, an email may be sent out to the\ntechnicians and managers that have requested it.   Email notifications can be set up to send a text\nmessage to a telephone number, using an SMS gateway.\n\n\n**Accounting system**\n\nEach mill sends a daily report of sales, vends, and pricing.  These items are gathered into Support\nCenter and checked for validity.\n\nManagers can display the summary reports from this data.  This is useful for proofing the data and\nwatching the updates come through the system.\n\nEach day a report is sent that contains all of the sales, vends, and pricing data that was changed\nsince the last report.  This data is delivered to an FTP site for importing into wexnet.\n\n\n**Diagnostic tools**\n\nThere are many diagnostic tools that can be run from the server.  These scripts make it very\nconvenient to maintain a large number of watermills without having to log into each one\nindependently.\n\nThere are several high-level tools that allow many other tools to work.\n\n    sc-milldo - execute a single command on a mill and bring back the results\n    sc-millput - push a single file to a watermill\n    sc-millget - pull a single file from a watermill\n    sc-each-mill - do a command for each watermill in the field\n\nUsing these basic tools it is very easy to build a sophisticated system to do advanced tasks in a\nreliable way.  NOTE: Extreme caution should be used when performing operations across all field mills.\n\n\n** Chapter 4 - Data Import/Export\n\n**File import mechanism**\n\nAll of the data that comes from the watermill is a simple text file.  On the mill the file is\ndropped in the /root/to-brighton directory.  It is then send using scp to the\nsandbox@65.121.123.211:sandbox directory.  Then the file is moved to the /root/to-brighton-sent\ndirectory on the mill.\n\nNightly the /root/to-brighton directory on every mill is checked to make sure that the data is\nbeing moved.\n\nA script called 'handle-sandbox.sh' brings the data into the account for Support Server.   A script\ncalled 'handle-inbox' will import each data file into the Support Center application.\n\n\n**Alerts**\n\nThe alerts arrive as files in the inbox.  Each file contains a recent alert history from that mill.\nThis allows alert files to be lost without losing any of the history.  This is really useful when a\nmill is offline for an extended period.\n\n\n**Health monitoring**\n\nEvery hour each mill records its cumulative vend counts, nine pressure readings, and tank level.\nEach day these logs are all sent to Support Center.  \n\nThe data is put in tables and painted into web pages for Support Center users.  Each month this data\nis archived into CSV files that can be used creating analysis tools.\n\nWhen diagnosing a problem on a watermill it is often useful to update the web pages with information\nfrom today.  There is a link on the mill page that pull fresh data from the watermill.\n\n\n**Accounting data**\n\nEach day every mill sends cumulative receipts, cumulative vend counts, and prices to Support Center.\nAll of this data is put into cumulative data tables.  From these values the daily values are\ndetermined.  All of the records that are changed are saved in an export table.\n\nThe records from the export table are sent into a CSV file nightly and cleared from the export\ntable.  If the accounting has already been exported then this operation is not repeated, so that\ndata loss can be prevented.\n\n\n**Executor (for remote command execution)**\n\nThe web server runs as a separate user under Apache.  When it want to excute shell commands a call\nis made to the executor.  This script creates a command, runs it, and puts the results back into\nSupport Center.\n\nCommand execution is reliable and there is a full history of what happened.  This is especially\nimportant when executing commands on remote watermills that may not complete correctly.\n\n\n**File storage to reconstruct**\n\nThe following directory structure lets us reconstruct any story long after the situation happens.\n\ndata\n accounting\n  3002\n  3003\n  ...\n  3204\n  3297\n  3999\n archive\n  2011-01\n  2011-02\n  ...\n  2011-11\n  2011-12\n collection\n commands\n imported\n inbox\n  received\n  rejected\n logs\n  3090\n pending\n pricing\n  today\n sql\n test\n  accounting\n tmp\n\nThe way that this would normally happend would be to do a pull on the staging server.   This would\navoid any interruption of business on the production server.  The a 'git checkout' would let the\nengineer roll back to an earlier moment in time.  Both the database and files will be configured to\nthe situation that needs investigation.\n\n\n** Chapter 5 - Commander & automation\n\n**Support Center Command**\n\nSupport Center is a web site that has convenient access to a database. There is also a command-line\ninterface to get access to the database.   'scc' is a super-command that allows scripts to use\nSupport Center functionality.\n\nSupport Center Commands (scc) take automation to a higher level.  An engineer can create a script\nthat will do a sequence of operations applied to all of the mills in the field.  This make it easy\nto chain sequences of activies together.\n\nscc combined with the Linux toolbox makes for a world-class automation platform.  Operations that\ncould take a person many days to complete can now be done in minutes of thoughtful programming and\ntesting.  \n\n\n**File import filters**\n\nAll data comes into Support Center as files. The format of the filename describes the type of data\nthat is being imported.  Each data type is defined with a filename pattern and a handler that knows\nhow to read the records for that datatype.\n\nThe following data file formats are supported:\n\n    executor\n    account\n    alert\n    log\n    pressure\n    tank\n    vend\n    cmd\n    result\n    collection  \n\nEvery file that does not match any pattern is sent to the 'rejected' folder.  This folder is checked\nhourly to see if any files have landed there. \n\n\n**Server scripts**\n\nEverything in Support Server is controlled by scripts.  This means there are a lot of individual\ncommands to learn.  The place to start is with the 'sc-help' command.  This lists the available\nscripts with a one-line description.\n\nSearching  /home/seaman/wme/support-git/scripts\nacc-to-csv      # Convert a CSV file to a millcmd accounting file\ncsv-to-acc      # Convert a CSV file to a millcmd accounting file\nfiles.py        # Utilities for scripts\nsc-admin        # Show remote Support Center admin view\nsc-apache       # Restart the local development web server\nsc-archive-month # Archive monthly data\nsc-changes      # Show the Git status\nsc-check-accounting # Check to make sure that all of the daily accounting is correct\nsc-checkout     # Checkout the code on the production server \nsc-clean        # Clean out all the extra files\nsc-clear-inbox  # Clear the inbox folders\nsc-commands     # List Watermill commands\nsc-commit       # Commit all the outstanding files\nsc-control-panel # Go to the Support Center control panel\nsc-crontab      # Setup the crontab with tasks for Support Center\nsc-daily        # Run daily testing\nsc-deploy       # Deploy the staging server code\nsc-do           # Run a script on the staging server\nsc-download     # Download the archive files from the production server\nsc-each-mill    # Do the requested command on every mill\nsc-exe          # Create a new Support Center control script\nsc-forward-file # Forward a file to the Support Center inbox\nsc-get          # Get a file from the staging server\nsc-handle-inbox # Handle the inbox files\nsc-help         # List Watermill commands\nsc-hourly       # Run hourly testing\nsc-import       # Import a single data file\nsc-inbox        # List the contents of the inbox folders\nsc-init-price   # Initialize all of the pricing for all mills \nsc-initialize   # Create a new Support Center control script\nsc-ip           # Lookup the mill ip address\nsc-loaddb       # Create a new database from the command line\nsc-log          # Show the Support Center log\nsc-milldo       # Execute a script on the mill using 211 as a gateway server\nsc-millget      # Get a file from the mill using 211 as a gateway server\nsc-millput      # Put a file on the mill using 211 as a gateway server\nsc-money-convert # Convert the money tables\nsc-monthly      # Run monthly testing\nsc-newdb        # Create a new database from the command line\nsc-newgit       # Create a new git repo on the production server \nsc-put          # Put a file on the staging server\nsc-qt           # Support Center quick test\nsc-same-file    # Make sure that these files are the same\nsc-savedb       # Save the database from the command line\nsc-send         # Send email using the STMP at seaman@comsystem.us\nsc-show         # Show local Support Center\nsc-showdb       # Show database info\nsc-sql          # Create a new database from the command line\nsc-start-inbox  # Run the import file handler\nsc-stop-inbox   # Stop the handler for the inbox\nsc-term         # Support Center terminal\nsc-test         # Test all of the Support Center code\nsc-test-accept  # Capture all test output as correct\nsc-test-capture # Capture initial output from all tests\nsc-test-check   # Compare the last output with the correct output\nsc-test-filter  # Put the test output through a filter\nsc-test-output  # Capture all test output as correct\nsc-test-results # Compare the last output with the correct output\nsc-test-running # Make sure that Support Center is running\nsc-test-verify  # Run a command and check the output\nsc-todo         # Add an idea to the todo list\nsc-web          # Show local Support Center\nsc-weekly       # Run weekly testing\nscc             # Execute Support Center commands\n\nBefore running any script for the first time you must know what it will do.   Most of the scripts\nare very short and easy to read.  The fastest way to learn about a new script is to use 'show'\n(eg. 'show sc-test' or 'show sc-web'). \n\nIf you cannot figure out what a script will do after reading it them don't run it.  You should know\nthe result before you execute the command.\n\n\n** Chapter 6 - Testing\n\n**Unit testing**\n\nSupport Center is equipped with a full set of unit tests.  These test are embedded in the Support\nCenter Python code.  To run all of the unit test go to the Support Server Console and type 'scc\ntest'.  \n\nThis will create a new database for testing.  It will create all of tables needed by reading\nthe Django source code.  It will then perform all of the tests defined in the 'tests.py' files in\nSupport Center.\n\nIt will then list all of the errors, exceptions, and failed tests.  If any tests fail then they must\nbe fixed immediately.  Failing tests indicate that something unexpected is happening in the system.\n\nAfter all of the tests are complete the test database is removed.  All tests are performed outside\nof the data for the running system.\n\n\n**File import testing**\n\nThe most important feature of the Support Center web application is that it reads data that comes\nfrom the watermills.  All of this data is imported by a collection of file import filters.   Each of\nthese scripts knows how to read one type of data and use it to perform system operations.  See the\nsection on \"File import filters\" to see the list of supported file types.\n\nThe file import testing is done by reading in a set of known data files and checking to make sure\nthat Support Center does the correct things with them.  Each test is unique to what is being read.\nThese tests all add, remove, query and update the data in the live database. \n\nThe tests are written so that no disruptive operations are performed.  Modification are made only to\nthe records of test mill '3999' which is a virtual mill.  This protects the customer data from being\nchanged by the test.\n\nIn order for all of the file import testing to succeed everything has to work together perfectly.\nAlmost any change in the file import system will cause some test to fail.  When the tests pass there\nis a high degree of confidence in the inbox mechanism as well as the specific file imports.\n\n\n**Executor testing**\n\nAll Linux system commands are executed outside of the web server.  This protects the web server from\nhanging if a Linux command were to hang.  Support Center is capable of initiating system commands\nthat talk to mills or that manipulate the server computer system.\n\nExecutor is the mechanism that runs commands for the web server.  A command is written to the inbox\nand imported like any other file.  The command import filter starts the execution and attempts to\ncreate a corresponding results file.\n\nWhen a result file is imported the page that requested the command is rendered and returned to the\nweb user.   This mechanism prevents the web server from hanging to wait for long running commands.\nThe user running the browser will have to wait to get the results, but other users of the system\nwill not be blocked.\n\n\n**Overall testing**\n\nThe entire system can be tested by initiating the 'sc-test' command.  This will find a directory\nfilled with test scripts and run all of them.  Currently it takes six minutes to perform all tests.\n\nEach test has a file that contains the perfect output for that test.  This makes it extremely easy\nto write new tests.   When the test returns the exact output that was expected it is said to pass.\nIf anything else is returned, then the test fails.\n\nAt the end of the tests a summary of all of the failures is sent by email to the engineering staff\nfor evaluation.  Any failing tests should be fixed right away.   This prevents the bit rot that\nnormally happens on system, due to the changing world around the system.\n\nTo fix failing test, use the 'sc-test-results'.   This lists both the tests that failed and the\nspecific expected output for each of the failures.\n\nStart by understanding why the unexpected results appeared.  Is it a recent change?  Is it a test\nthat is to simple?   Is the test too critical?   Does it use today's data?\n\nCommon fixes include discarding certain output from the test, accepting the actual output as the new\ncorrect answer, or rethinking how the test is performed.\n\nThe power of this approach is that it is very easy to constantly extend the testing to cover new\nsituations. Each time new functionality is added then a new test can be added to ensure that the\nfunction is working in its basic form.\n\nIf this system is used properly it will guarantee that everything will continue to work well all the\ntime. To encourage this, the 'sc-test' command is run automatically each day with email sent to the\nengineer staff.\n\n\n**Checkup system**\n\nEach morning at 3:00 the checkup script is run.  This will perform a full test of the Support\nServer.  It will also do regularly scheduled maintenance tasks that are needed (eg. backup, log\nrotation, disk space management).\n\nEach of the field mills also has special support tasks that must be done.  The script\n'sc-checkup-mill' is run to do testing and maintenance of a single mill.   'sc-each-mill' is used to\nrun the checkup on every watermill in the system.\n\n\n** Chapter 7 - Mill diagnostics\n\n**Diagnostics from server**\n\nThere are many diagnostic tools that can be run from the server.  These scripts make it very\nconvenient to maintain a large number of watermills without having to log into each one\nindependently.\n\nThere are several high-level tools that allow many other tools to work.\n\n    sc-milldo - execute a single command on a mill and bring back the results\n    sc-millput - push a single file to a watermill\n    sc-millget - pull a single file from a watermill\n    sc-each-mill - do a command for each watermill in the field\n\nUsing these basic tools it is very easy to build a sophisticated system to do advanced tasks in a\nreliable way.  NOTE: Extreme caution should be used when performing operations across all field mills.\n\n\n**Mill monitor**\n\nThere are currently three types of data that are logged on the watermills hourly.  This data is sent\nfrom the mill and cleared daily.  Each of these are logged hourly to analyze time-of-day trends.\n\n    vends - all nine product vend counts \n    pressure - during idle, ro, flush  -- readings of input, ro feed, ro pressure\n    tank  - tank level in gallons\n\n\n**MCP**\n\nAnother tool to debug watermills is MCP (mill control program). This program is run by logging into\na console window on the watermill.  This is a text based program that can be used to view values and\nchange a few of them.\n\n\n**Diagnostics**\n\nAll of the diagnostics are located on the server and distributed nightly to all of the watermills.\nThere are different types of mills so the script 'push-diagnostics' is able to determine the\ndiagnostics that are needed on a given mill.\n\nNOTE: This feature is currently disabled because of the pending roll of both old and new\nwatermills.  It will be enabled once the roll is complete.\n\n\n** Chapter 8 - Support process and training\n\n**Support Sever Operations**\n\nThis document describes how to use Support Center to accomplish various support tasks.  It is\nwritten for helping the users of Support Center know what to do.\n\n\n**Support Server Design**\n\nThis document describes the engineering view of Support Server and the embedded Support Center web\napplication, and scripts.  It is important to thoroughly understand this document in order to modify\nany of the components within Support Server.\n\n\n**Tech Notes**\n\nSupport Center contains an embedded system for displaying and editing technical notes.\n\n\n** Chapter 9 - Development process\n\n**Automated testing**\n\nManual testing is very expensive.  Typically it is used to \"poke around\" to see if anything is\nbroken.  For a system as complex as Support Server most problems will not be found with this type of\ntesting.  Our history has been that some problems have hidden in the system for months before\ndiscovery. Unknown problems in a system can be very costly.\n\nAutomatic tests can be performed daily (or hourly if needed).  This is the only cost-effective way to \nkeep a system like Support Server functioning properly.\n\nThe key to using automatic testing is to fix every failing test immediately.  It is tempting to\nignore a failing test, but the will result in a much worse problem occurring.\n\nThere are five unique types of automated tests done within Support Server: file imports, executor,\nunit tests, sc-test, system checkup.   Each of these testing types will reveal certain problems.\nEach of these test will require maintenance.\n\n\n**Develop and test locally**\n\nAll development should be performed on an isolated computer system.   The 'support-git' repository\ncontains a full set of files to create a full self-contained server.  In only requires an Ubuntu\ninstallation with Apache, MySql, and Django installed.\n\n    sc-help - Show me useful commands\n    sc-changes, sc-commit, sc-push - Used to manage changes locally\n    sc-test - Run all automatic test (don't push without running this first)\n    sc-apache - Run the local app within Apache\n\n\n**Deploy on staging server**\n\nWhen the code has been tested and committed on the development machine it can be fully deployed onto\nthe staging server with a single command.\n\n    sc-deploy - Push and pull from the staging server, restart Apache\n    sc-staging-term - From a dev machine show a terminal window\n    sc-staging-web - From a dev machine show the Support Server web page\n    sc-test - Run all of the automatic tests on the staging server (run on wmexpress2)\n\n\n**Deploy on production server**\n\nAfter the code is thoroughly tested and reviewed then it can be promoted from the staging server to\nthe production server.\n\n    sc-promote - Deploy the current code on the production server (always run from staging)\n    sc-web - From a dev machine show the Support Server web page\n\n\nSee also SupportCenterOperation \n\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Support Center Design"}}, {"pk": 431, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/BrothersInArms", "text": "* Brothers In Arms *                 -*-muse-*-\nMost men go it alone.

Here is the model that I am currently using.  I believe it to be pretty accurate.\n\nA complex system can really be decomposed into a set of discrete task.  Each task solve a unique\ntechnical problem.  Every task has two parts (learning, and doing).  Each task that requires about\nan hour of engineering, on average, once the process is fully understood.\n\n**Learning vs. Doing**\n\nA competent engineer can learn a new trick in about a day.  Each time a trick is performed the\nlearning time for that trick is cut in half.  After about four times the task is automated or super\neasy to repeat.\n\nA complex system can be estimated by estimating the sum of the effort of the tasks.  Each task is\ncalculated to be 1 hour plus 8 hours for each new trick to learn.  I also use partial learning\ncredits of 2 hours and 4 hours for tasks that have been done rarely.\n\n**System Scope**\n\nThere are four distinct parts to creating a web application.  Each of these aspects can present\nunique engineering problems.  A task breakdown should be done for each aspect to create an estimate.\n\nI try to use technologies that are already familiar to eliminate the required learning.  Here's how\nI would estimate the following using familiar technologies\n\nSetup Hosting \n     Account setup - 1 hour \n     Application setup - 1 hour \n     Version control - 1 hour \n     Automated scripting - 1 hour\n\nApplication Logic\n     Scales by data type - 3 hours/type (add, modify, find)\n    * Typical web application involves about 10 data types\n     Each data type requires storage and views for CRUD ops\n     Application framework - URLs, views, models, etc. - scales by type\n     Gather user content - no time budgeted for this\n\nData Import/Export\n     How does data enter and leave the system?\n     File import/export operations\n     Email interfaces\n     Transactions on web service\n     Estimate using the 1 hour + learning model\n\nTesting\n     Unit testing - all functionality should be automatically tested - 2 hours\n     File import testing via scripted interface - 2 hours\n     Overall testing - 2 hours\n     Checkup system - embedded self test - 2 hours\n\n**Summary**\n\nSetup Hosting       - 4 hours - 36 hours the first time \nApplication Logic   - 30 hours - 150 hours if learning new technology \nData import/export  - 4 hours - 36 hours if learning \nTesting - 8 hours   - 64 hours to learn\n\nTotal investment - 42 hours with no learning - 300-400 hours with learning everything\n\nThis matches my actual experience with learning several new platforms.\n\n**Eliminating the Learning Curve**\n\nOne thing that comes from this analysis is the need to eliminate the learning curve.  Any good\nprogrammer can learn to do what is required to complete any job.  But the cost effectiveness is\nbased on how many times each trick has been performed.\n\nThe primary choice of technology is not based on the inherent effectiveness of the technology, but\non the actual effectiveness of the individual using it.  I believe that the differences between any\ntwo technologies is a second-order effect.\n\nA well trained engineer using .Net, Django, JSP, or PHP, will produce about the same level of\noutput.  There is no silver bullet.\n\nThe thing to avoid is climbing a new learning curve, unless you plan on getting a long-term benefit\nfor it.\n\n\nSee also WorldClassSoftware\n\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Software Estimation"}}, {"pk": 434, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/ReviewCycles", "text": "* Review Cycles *                 -*-muse-*-\n\n**Objective:** Create a regular pattern of reviews at different intervals\n\n**Year**\nreview the past 4 quarters and envision the future\nspend December 31 each year\nbenefit: review progress toward life goals\n\n**Quarter**\nreview the past 3 months and envision the future\nspend the last Saturday of the quarter\nbenefit: update annual goals, spiritual review\n\n**Month**\nreview the past weeks and envision the future\nspend two hours on the last Saturday of each month\nbenefit: monthly objectives\n\n**Week**\nreview the past week and plan the coming one\nspend two hours each Sunday afternoon\nbenefit: create short-term priorities\n\n**Day**\nthink about yesterday and plan today\nspend one hour each day\nbenefit: quiet reflection outside of the project activity\n\nSee also PersonalRetreat, SpiritualReview, SpiritualRetreat, MonthlyObjectives, LifeGoals\n", "user": 3, "title": "Review Cycles"}}, {"pk": 435, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/SetupMini", "text": "* Setup Mini *                 -*-muse-*-\n\n* HISTORY\n\n    9 July 2009 (created 9 July 2009)\n\n        Recover working system using Maxtor\n        File sharing\n        Upgrade to 8.10\n        Create new boot volume on Signature\n        Setup history\n            Assign shortcut to Root Terminal (Ctrl-Space)\n            Change editor settings (3 spaces, no backup)\n            Enabled wireless connect\n            Copy files from Signature drive\n    Mini Netbook Remix\n\n    12 February 2010 (created 12 February 2010)\n\n        History of the upgrade on Mini\n            * Google search for netbook remix\n            * Download the ISO image\n            * \"Create the USB startup disk\" using the thumb drive\n            * Boot the system and press F9 to boot off the thumb drive\n            * Use try without installing to make sure drivers can be found\n            * Connect a LAN cable\n            * Activate the hardware drivers (for BroadCom and STA)\n            * System hung\n            * Reboot and install off of thumbdrive\n            * Use entire hard drive\n            * Connect a LAN cable\n            * Setup keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl-Space, Alt-W)\n            * Setup ssh key to server\n            * Activate the hardware drivers (for BroadCom and STA)\n            * Configure the wireless network -

I thought it might be\na useful here as a resource for epublishing Newbies, as well as other writers who have questions and\ncontributions.  For those whove been around awhile, you may want to skip to the second posting on\nPromotion.\n\nThis is a fact: Epublishing is revolutionizing publishing, an event no less important to\nintellectual discourse than the penny newspapers of the nineteenth century.\n\nEpublishing is a viable option to seeking a traditional publisher.  Not only are established writers\npublishing original material to Kindle (and other ebook platforms), but indie writers are being\noffered traditional DTB (dead tree book) contracts based on their ebooks.  While the ebook market is\nstill only 9% of the total book market (as of 10/2010), it is a growing market.  Consumers are\nexpected to buy one billion dollars in ebooks by the end of the year.  So lets get aboard.\n\n**HOW TO GET STARTED**\n\nThere is no charge to upload your manuscript to Amazon Kindle (or any of the other ebook platforms,\nincluding Smashwords, PubIt, Kobo, iPad, Borders, Android, Sony, and Diesel). You do not have to own\na Kindle to publish on Kindle. You do not have to own a Kindle to read Kindle books (there is a free\ndownload application for your computer on the Amazon website).\n\nThere are a handful of simple steps. Prepare your manuscript, then proof and format it to\nperfection. Prepare your sales pitch, design a cover, decide on a price. Once you have these\nelements together, it takes only about one hour per venue. You can finish writing a novel on Monday,\npost it on Tuesday, and start making money on Friday (it takes a few days for Amazon to process it).\n\nFor Kindle, it is easier if you have a U.S. bank. Smashwords pays through PAYPAL, and is therefore\nmore international.  Kindle pays monthly, Smashwords pays quarterly.\n\n**PREPARING YOUR MANUSCRIPT**\n\n**1. COPY EDITING.** Have several people proof your work. Have at least three people (preferably fellow\nwriters) read your manuscript for typos.  And/or hire a professional (which will cost $300 \n$1,000). If you need or want an editor, someone who chops and cuts and moves material around, and\nquestions you about word choice, narrative flow, storyline, etc., that will run from $2,000-$8,000,\nand will take two weeks to a month.\n\nDo an Edit/Find on redundant and passive words, such as that, starts and begins, of the,\nturned, the phone and some of the, was and were.\n\nIf you cannot afford a copy editor, here's another technique several indies have employed.  Transfer\nyour book file to your Kindle and use the text to speech.  Read along with a hard copy of your\nmanuscript.  You'll be astonished by what you catch.  Very helpful and costs nothing.\n\nNOTE: Kindle, Smashwords, and most ereaders allow readers to download a sample before buying your\nbook. Most readers will do this, SO MAKE THE BEGINNING OF YOUR BOOK FABULOUS. It must read so a\nperson is intrigued, has to know more, will not sleep until he reads more.\n\n\n**2. Create a Word file** \n\nPut all of your files into one Microsoft Word document (including title page), single spaced,\njustified. Times Roman or Arial font, or something simple. (Not courier.) Many prefer using the EPUB\nfile format. See Christian Cantrells Blog below.  Before you upload to Kindle, check your\nformatting as Amazon converts it using HTML.\n\nMake sure you have no tabs.  Do an Edit Replace for ^t, replacing it with nothing. Then highlight\nyour entire document, and use the Format, Paragraph, Indent first line feature.  (Or you can double\nspace between paragraphs.)\n\nKindle is much more flexible about format than Smashwords, but to save you from formatting your\nmanuscript twice, you might want to abide by Smashword rules (which you can read at Smashwords.com).\nTitles and headings should not be larger than 18 pitch.\n\n\n**3. Add copyright**  After your title page, you want to put something like:\n\nDigital Edition Copyright  2010 by Author Name All rights reserved\n \nThe  symbol supposedly protects the text internationally. As I understand it, as soon as you've\ncreated a text, it's copyrighted in the U.S., but that allows you only the ability to stop\nrepublication by someone else. If you register the copyright with the Library of Congress, you are\nable to collect money damages. For more information, see http://copyrightregistery-gov-form.com/\n\nIf a publisher reads what you have on Kindle, and wants to do a DTB (dead tree book), you have all\nrights to sell it to them. I know of several indies who have found publishers this way.\n\n\n**4. Save as HTML** \n\nWhen you are done formatting, SAVE AS a web page (HTML). This is the document you will want to\nupload to Kindle.\n\n\n**5. Create cover** \n\nA great cover does a lot to sell a book. You can design your own with free online photos and a photo\nmanipulation program. Photoshop is great but expensive. Gimp is free. An excellent list of websites\nwhere you can download free photos is: http://www.photoshopsupport.com/resources/stock-photos.html\n\nYou want the title and author name to be really big, with a single intriguing image. A light cover,\nletters at least 1/4 the size of the cover, lots of red. Yellow is good for title. (Look at a Kindle\nbook called THIN BLOOD, a brilliant cover.)\n\nWhile you are working on your cover, reduce the image at times to 1-1/4 inch highthis is about how\nbig it will appear on the computer. If it doesnt pop out at you, or isnt easily read, change it.\n\n\n**6. Create Blurb** You need to write a short synopsis, not more than 400 words. Shorter is better. Give\nthe synopsis to friends and ask if theyd be intrigued enough to read the book.\n\nSHORT BLURB: You need to write a very short synopsis of 400 characters. This shorter version youll\nneed for Smashwords, and for self-promotion on blogs and websites.\n\nSpend serious time on these synopses. This, apart from your cover, is your main sales tool.\n\n\n**7. PRICING:**\n\nA lot of writers first post their books for .99 cents because a number of Kindle readers routinely\nbuy only .99 books. It is a way to get a following. Think of it as an introductory price. The\nminimum for which you can get at 70% royalty is $2.99, which is why many indie Kindle books are\n$2.99. The DTB publishers often list their books at $9.99 or higher because they can. Many writers\nthink it's the DTB publishers way to suppress the ebook market, and to maintain a demand for\nDTBs. But readers have made it clear on the forums that they think it is unfair to post an ebook for\nmore than a paperback.\n\nIn other words, $9.99 is probably too much for an indie ebook. Keep it under $5.00.\n\nAt some point you might want to change your price. If, for instance, you post at .99 cents and it\nsells like crazy, getting you to the top 100 Kindle Best Sellers list, you might want to keep it at\n.99 cents until you drop off. (The big deal about the top 100 is that it is a visible list that is\npromoted by Amazon. A major goal is to get on this list.) But if you are not making a lot of sales\nat .99 cents, you might as well go to $2.99 for awhile. I've had books that began to sell more when\nI raised the price.\n\nThere is no stigma for .99 books on Amazon. DTB Publishers sometimes run very cheap specials (or\nfree) for their best sellers. Everyone, in other words, is trying to find a good price point.\n\nAnother technique--Amazon will \"discount\" your book if it is being sold cheaper elsewhere. You can\nsell it lower at Smashwords, or keep it the same and sign up for distribution at Kobo, which\nautomatically discounts. Then Amazon will slash your price from say $2.99 to $2.39. People will\nthink they are getting a deal. You'll simply have to test out what works best for you.\n\n\n**8. UPLOADING:**\n\nYou are ready to upload. There are a number of websites you can upload your ebook. Kindle,\nSmashwords, PubIt, etc.  Kindle is the best, so well start with that.\n\nGo to https://dtp.amazon.com/mn/signin\n\nRegister, then follow directions.\n\n-Upload book and synopsis. Set price. Remember, you may want to start with a promotional price of\n.99 for two weeks, then move to $2.99 where you'll get the 70 percent royalty\n\n-Be sure to preview your book. It is laborious, but necessary.\n\n-Add your bank account information with electronic routing number. If you are unsure about your wire\nrouting number, call your bank.\n\n-Follow directions and add tags, categories, and other information.\n\n-Kindle takes several days to upload your book, and will send you an email when it is\ncomplete. While you wait, start working on your marketing strategy.\n\n\n**9. CHANGES**:\n\nAt any point after you have published, you CAN make changes. You can change the\nprice. You can make editorial changes and upload again. You can change your cover and\nsynopsis. Amazon may take your book offline for up to 48 hours, so you dont want to do this\nexcessively, but it is hugely comforting to know that once its gone to print, its not carved in\nstone.\n\n**10. BACKLIST TITLES**\n\nMany authors are uploading to Kindle previously published books when they get their rights back. You\nneed a letter from your publisher confirming Reversion of Rights. Upload your book. Within a few\ndays, Amazon will contact you and ask you to scan in your letter and send it to them. Within four or\nfive days, your book will be approved.\n\n-Smashwords does not require such a letter.\n\n\n**11. Barnes & Noble** \nhas recently established an epublication website, PubIt. It works much the same as Kindle:\nhttp://pubit.barnesandnoble.com/pubit_app/bn?t=pi_reg_home&code=4aa51434099049dc9bbb6f75872a952f\n\n\n**12. AMAZON KINDLE for UK WRITERS:**\nYou have to join on the USA site with your UK password if you are already a customer, and when you\ncreate your account it has US and UK buttons to turn on or off.\n\nUK royalty is 30% regardless of where you are. They send a check in . If it is sold in US then they\nsend a check for 70% (if it is between $2.99 and $9.99).  They only send checks when it is over\n$100, and will charge you $8 per check.  \n\n\n**13. PROMOTION:**\n\nThe most difficult part about selling ebooks is getting the word out about them.\n\nFor my first Kindle book \"Amsterdam 2012\", I mentioned it on the Amazon Kindle forum and here on\nKindleboards.com. That was it. And it took off, selling over 1,000 copies the first weekend. Most\npromotion is word of mouth--doing guest postings on other writers' blogs, finding interest groups\nand pitching your book (e.g., if you have a book about dogs, pitching it to websites for dog\nlovers), participating in various writers groups, reviewing other writers' works. The self-promotion\nis time-intensive, and, yes, annoying. But even traditional publishers insist their writers do a lot\nof self-promotion on their own (my last publisher asked me to hire a publicist!) There are some\nwebsites that review ebooks only. Soon there will be established review venues. Right now everyone\nis kind of flying by the seat of their britches.\n\nAUTHOR COMMUNITIES to Join and to Promote Your Books:\n\n- Kindleboards.com. Sign up and promote your book on the Bizarre forum. Participate in as many\ndiscussions as you have time for. Post questions if you want. Everyone is very helpful. These boards\nlist a lot of other venues where you can advertise your book.\n\n-Amazon Kindle, Discussions, Kindle Forum. There are several threads where you can plug your\nbook. Let friends know about where youve plugged your book, so they can comment on your remark and\nkeep it on the first page of comments. This helps enormously in sales. I do not recommend posting a\nnew thread about your book, although many do. Several trolls are very harsh to writers who hog\nthe forum for self-promotion. Use this venue with caution.\n\n-Goodreads.com. Become a member and promote your book. If you spend time on their discussion boards\nand make \"friends\", they can be really helpful.\n\n-Nookboards.com. Become a member and promote your book.\n\n-Soundings:Puget Sound Speaks. Promote on Board Index, Independent authors\n\n-Mobileread.com. Become a member and promote your book on the authors promotion thread.\n\n-Librarything.com. Become a member and promote your book.\n\n-shelfari.com.\n\n-Redroom.com.  Become a member and post blogs entries and stories.  They have weekly writing\nchallenges that are widely read.\n\n-NOTE: Whenever you see that one of your author \"friends\" has a post on the Kindle Forums, chime in,\nor ask them a question so they can respond, further bumping their thread. They will do the same for\nyou. You can follow these forums--Amazon will send you an alert, if you want, every time someone\nposts.\n\nAUTHOR BLOGS and REVIEW SITES: Here You Can Ask to Have Your Book Reviewed or be a Guest Blogger:\n\nhttp://theindiespotlight.blogspot.com/ Fill out their author's interview questionnaire. They will post your book in about 3 weeks.\nhttp://indiebooksblog.blogspot.com/\nhttp://spaldings-racket.blogspot.com/\nhttp://redadeptreviews.com/\nhttp://simon-royle.com\nhttp://dailycheapreads.com\nhttp://candysraves.com\nhttp://bookbuzzr.com\nhttp://thefrugalereader.blogspot.com\nhttp://hf-connection.com  (Historical Fiction Connection)\nhttp://booksontheknob.blogspot.com\nhttp://kindle-author.blogspot.com\nhttp://coffeeandroses.blogspot.com\nhttp://bellaonline.com\nhttp://trishasbookshelf.blogshopt.com\nhttp://paperbackdolls.blogspot.com\nhttp://www.kindleobsessed.com/\nhttp://thecajunbooklady.com\nhttp://theunreadreader.com\nhttp://kindlereader.blogspot.com\nhttp://twoendsofthepen.blogspot.com\nhttp://tinasbookreview.com\nhttp://rexreadingrobot.com\nhttp://cherylsbooknook.blogspot.com\nhttp://myreadingroom-crystal.blogspot.com\nhttp://lostforwords-corrine.blogspot.com\nhttp://www.jennsbookshelves.com/\nhttp://www.booksandchat.net/\nhttp://www.thenovelblog.com/\nhttp://kindlehomepage.blogspot.com Kindle Nation Daily, a promotional site. Promotional blitzes start at $59.\nhttp://www.kindleboards.com also has a daily paid promotion available.\n \nSimon Royle has another good list at:  \nhttp://www.simon-royle.com/indie-reviewers\n\nScott Nicholson has a good list from his blog tour (emphasis on horror reviewers):\nhttp://www.hauntedcomputer.com/booktour.htm\n\nThere are many, many more. Many are mentioned here on Kindleboards.com from time to time. It is a\nquestion of networking and favors, but this shared promotion is invaluable.\n\nOther Promotional Tools to Know About:\n\n- Tagging. On your book page on Amazon, there is a place where you can list \"tags\" or key words that\nhelp people find your book. Add tags, then go to Kindleboards and ask fellow writers to tag your\nbook. This will get your book up on the rankings for specific types of books. Very important.\n\n- Author Page on Amazon. Amazon now gives you an author page where you can write about anything you\nwant to promote yourself. Put up a picture and stuff about yourself. You need to set up a separate\npage for Amazon UK.\n\n-Facebook and Twitter. Lots of writers use Facebook to promote their books. Become a fan of other\nwriters on FB, and they will do the same.\n\n-If you have published DTBs, do a book giveaway on Goodreads.com.\n\n-Blog tours.  Contact all of the sites you would like to appear on, and ask to be a guest blogger\nduring a specific promotion period.  Line them all up, get your blogs prepared, and promote your\ntour.  Several authors have sponsored a Kindle raffle for viewers.\n\n-Some authors have tried listing their book as an ebook on CD on Ebay.  The Ebay listing costs $.50\nfor a 30 day listing.  Add S&H costs.  The object here is not so much to sell CDs but to entice\nKindle owners to see the book and then check for the book on Amazon.\n\n**14. READER REVIEWS:**\nReader Reviews are key to selling books.\n\n-You can ask for reviews on Kindleboards.\n\n-You can go to authonomy.com and post part or all of your book. When people comment on it, you can\nask them to post their review on Amazon.\n\n-Many reviewers on Amazon make their emails available. You can send them an email and ask them to\nreview your book--sending them a free version or a Smashwords coupon.\n\n-Amazon ranks Kindle books. Your goal is to get in the top 100, because there is a list of best\nsellers which gives you wide visibility.\n\n-Once you start getting reviews, keep a list of people who liked it, and then email them about your\nnext book.\n\n-Facebook. Ask for reviews from your FB fans.\n\n-Start a blog. If you can figure out something to say once a week (or every day) that people want to\nhear, you draw a lot of folk. Quite a few writers have started blogs where other writers can promote\ntheir works.\n\n-Reviewing other peoples books is a good way to get your book reviewed.\n\n-Youtube. Lots of people are doing book trailers on Youtube. So far, the time, money, and effort\ninvested in book trailers has not translated into huge sales for most writers.\n\n-It's all about connections and relationships. Doing little favors for people, and they returning\nlittle favors.\n\n\n**15. PAYMENT:**\n\nKindle pays 70% royalties on books $2.99 to $9.99. For books .99-$2.99, and over 9.99\nthe royalty is 35%. Payment is 60 days after the close of the month. Smashwords pays 70% through\nPaypal and quarterly (unless it is sold through another outlet through Smashwords). PubIt: Books\nbelow $2.99: 40%; Books from $2.99 - $9.99: 65%; Books over $9.99: 40%\n\nIf you're in the US, that minimum in royalties is $10.00 for payment to a bank account, and $100.00\nif you want them to cut you a check. If you do require a check, then they charge an $8.00 fee out of\nthat before they pay you.\n\n\n**16. COUPON:** \n\nSmashwords allows you to create coupons for your books. You can give this virtual coupon (a number)\nto anyone, and they can use it to buy your book on Smashwords. You can do a promotional \"giveaway\"\nor \"contest\", posting it on forums and websites.\n\n\n**17.  OTHER RESOURCES:**\n\nAn excellent resource for epublishing is J.A. Konraths, The Newbies Guide to Publishing, only\n$2.99.\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Newbies-Publishing-Everything-Writer-ebook/dp/B003I6496Y\n\nJoes blog, http://www.jakonrath.blogspot.com, is also very informative, and very inspiring.\n\nAlso, adobe expert Christian Cantrells Blog is helpful:\nhttp://www.livingdigitally.net/2010/09/everything-you-need-to-know-about-how-to-digitally-self-publish.html\n\n\n**18. NOTE:** \n\nDon't try to do it all at once. Work an hour or two a day on your book upload. Format it one\nday. Spend two days on the cover. One day for your synopsis. One day for uploading it. Once it is\nup, spend a half hour a day promoting it. First on Kindleboards, Mobilereads, Nookboards. Isn't that\nbetter than fretting about your &$&## agent, or the piles of rejection letters?\n\nRemember, once it is up, you start making money immediately. You ARE a published writer who is\nmaking money. Now isn't that what you always wanted?\n\n\nSee also [[Writing]]\n\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Kindle Publishing"}}, {"pk": 447, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/VirtualBuildMachine", "text": "* Virtual Build Machine *                 -*-muse-*-\n\n*Virtual watermill build machine*\n\n**Goals & Benefits**\nCreate a portable VM to create watermill builds.\nUse on Sub to isolate native OS from build OS.\nAllow risk-free upgrade of OS on Sub.\n\n**Steps**\n\nDownload Virtual Box software from web site\n - select download 10.04 LTS - 64 bit\n - download sub install package -\n   [[https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads][Download 10.04 64]]\n   [[http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/server-storage/virtualbox/downloads/virtualbox-4.1_4.1.8-75467~Ubuntu~oneiric_amd64.deb][Download 11.10 64]]\n - install on sub\n\nDownload VMs from Virtual Box web site\n - download guest ubuntu image for 11.10 - 32 -  [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/virtualboximage/files/Ubuntu%20Linux/11.10/ubuntu_11.10-x86.7z/download][Download]]\n - move into ~/Archive/Tools\n\nRun VM\n - double-click appliance in Nautilus\n - startup Linux machine\n - login ubuntu,reverse\n - exit VB app, save machine state\n - install guest additions\n - failed to fix keyboard problem (hit a dead-end)\n\nDownload Turn Key Core\n - http://www.turnkeylinux.org/core\n - cd ~/Archive/Tools/VirtualBox \n - unzip unzip turnkey-core-11.3-lucid-x86-ovf.zip\n - double click 'ovf' file\n\nSetup Core on Sub\n - setup user ids at first boot  (MS1959li)\n - accept security updates\n - quit from Advanced setup menu\n - test Turn Key Core VM on Sub\n\n                                    <-------- Done -----------<\n\nMove to Hummer\n\nTest basic usage\n - confirm start/stop Virtual Box\n - confirm startup and shutdown\n - measure performance (cat /proc/cpuinfo)\n\nCreate environment in VM\n - create  seaman user\n - clone files\n - install app stack\n - computer cloner\n - move into ~/Archive/Tools/'VirtualBox'\n\nMove UbuntuInWindows VM onto Sub\nSetup GIT repos\nFirst build and test\nMove VM to other system\n\n\nSee also VirtualBox\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Virtual Build Machine"}}, {"pk": 448, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/FollowUp", "text": "* Follow Up *                 -*-muse-*-\n\nActions needed to develop business relationships\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\n**Initial Ping Linked in** \n\nDustin Morris   7-31\nRick Lesser     8-1\nJeff Beemer     7-31\nGreg Begay      7-31\nRob Yockey      7-31\nKen Stockton    7-31\nEd Beeman       7-31\nKevin Bier      8-1\nFrank Kurucz\nJordan Brewer\nStacey Campbell\nJohn Dutton     8-21\nBeth Delaney    8-21\nSteve Hines     8-21\nJerry Donovan   8-21\n\n\nI was just browsing Linked In and ran across your link.

I have only been here for 8 weeks or so. I am still\ncoming up to speed, but so far I like it a lot. Nice to be back in a more R&D like environment. Also\nstill has a nice small feel to it.

I have been working for one main client for four years now. I'm winding down that\ncontract and looking for new work.\n\nOur three kids are all growed up. Christine, 30, lives with us and is working for a small\nmanufacturing company. Josiah, 27, is married and working on a doctorate in Bio-informatics, at\nCU. Rachel, 24, is living in Japan where she works for the Prefecture of Kagoshima.\n\nStacie and I moved to our dream house on a lake in Windsor three years ago. We are all very happy.\n\nGreat to catch up with you.\n\nFrank:\nSo far it's been good. I work in the old Sun Microsystems division, in the Solaris team, which has a\nculture that reminds me of the old pre Carly HP. As you probably know, Mark Hurd is a big wig here,\nbut he's fundamentally the Chief Salesman, so he doesn't affect us worker bees the way he did at\nHP. Larry Ellison does believe in actually growing the company and there has been some hiring. My\nboss is very flexible and I work at home 2 days a week, which is nice as the commute from Loveland\nis long.\n\nI have heard that other parts of the company (the non Sun groups) are not as pleasant to work in.\n\nHope all is well with you and your family. Our youngest (Sam) starts college this fall. He'll be\nattending UNC in Greeley (his older sister also goes to UNC) as he wants to be a high school\nteacher.

-*-muse-*-\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nThe objective of this book is to discuss the Django web framework and\npresent enough information to enable you to go from no previous knowledge of Django\nto building a web application using Django.  \n\nIn addition to getting an overview of Django, I'm going to dive into some detail on the\n50 Tricks that are essential to building an application.  Building a web\napplication, or any other program for that matter, is really a matter of understanding\nthe specific tricks that you need to do to get your technical work done and then\nassembling those tricks based on the needs of your application.  \n\nPresentationGoals\n\nBy the end of this book you will know how to create a running web application using the 50 Tricks.  The 50 Tricks are a catalogue of best practices that will provide you with one interesting way to solve a particular problem - rather than present all the possible ways that you might solve that particular problem.  \n\nWhatsDjango\n\nSo let's start by talking about Django.  Django is a framework that is very\nsimilar to ASP.net or Rails or JSP and it's based on a language in the same way that\nC-sharp is used to write ASP.net applications or Ruby is used to write Rail\napplications.  So Python is to Django like Ruby is to Rails.  Building a web\napplication requires both a great computer language and a framework that solves\na lot of the recurring problems for you.  When you select a programming language, you also need to select a framework. \n\nWhyDjango\n\nThere are many different frameworks written in Python. I selected Django after evaluating a number of other frameworks such as Pyramid, for example.  Django offers a great set of features and it's also interesting that Django was created by factoring real world applications.  A number of different applications were created and then the commonality, the common\nelements of those applications, were re-factored into a library that could be used on future applications.  \n\nSome frameworks are created by analyzing a problem in the abstract and then developing a framework, Django was developed by capturing real world applications in specific elements that were reusable within that. This avoids the Ivory Tower design problem and ensures that everything in the library is there for a reason. When you re-factor real applications; you end\nup with a minimalistic framework, rather than a conglomeration of everything that someone could think to include - everything is there because it has an immediate use in an actual\nsituation.  \n\nAnother thing that attracted me to Django is the docs are probably better than any other technical documentation I've read.  There are a number of different hosting options available.  I recommend the kind of hosting where you pay about 10 bucks a month and get a shared virtual server that can be set up in about an hour.  The result is, with the investment of about an hour's worth of time and 10 bucks a month, you can host your application. I set up new hosting for each new Django app I develop because the hosting is virtually free, compared to the development time.\n\nThe other thing that's really nice about Django is it's really great for automation.\nYou can expose all of the functionality of your running application, your running\nGUI.  You can expose that either as a web service or as a set of scripts that you\ncan use with command line operations to do the same thing.  I find that this is\nreally, really useful for doing automated testing and there's a lot of automated testing capabilities built into the framework itself.  \n\nLearnByDoing\n\nI believe in learning by doing.  The fastest way to learn something is to pick a project and pick a technology - dive in and figure out what problems you need to solve along the way rather than trying to learn a lot about the technology before you start working on a project.  This is a similar approach to the refactoring of applications into a framework, creating a INSERTlearning a technology like creating an application is the fastest way to go.  The project we'll use as an example for this book is a wiki.\n\n\nFiftyTricks\n\nLet's talk about 50 Tricks.  There are two types of knowledge: there is a broad base\nof engineering knowledge which involves things like how to define a software project,\nhow to design the actual writing of the code, the debugging and testing of that code.\nThat's a general body of knowledge that is very transportable from project to project\nand from technology to technology.  \n\nThe other type of knowledge that engineers have that is valuable is a specific\ntechnology that translates into a catalogue of how to solve specific\nproblems.  I'm calling these tricks because, once you know a specific trick, you can\napply that trick in about an hour.  But to learn a new trick, takes about a day's\nworth of experimentation and messing around.  And I'm hoping that this presentation\nwill short-circuit that activity for you so that you can see one successful way to do\neach trick and then, when you're working on your pile of project, you can basically\njust draw from my catalogue of tricks and then maybe in a couple of hours, have a\nworking knowledge of how to apply that trick, rather than a whole day.  \n\nThis idea of tricks is what explains the difference between people that are very\neffective at using a technology and people that are just learning that technology.  If\nyou switch technologies, you basically flush your bag of tricks and have to restock it\nwith that new technology.  So if you're a really good Ruby programmer and you are\ngoing to Python for the first time, for example, you will have to restock your tricks,\nrelearn the -- even though you may know a lot of the Ruby tricks for doing all of\nthese things that we're going to present, you will have to go back and relearn each of\nthe tricks for the technology that you're trying to do. \n\nSo if we compare two programmers, one that is very fluent in a technology and one that\nis not fluent and the average application requires about 50 tricks, this whole project\ncan be completed in about 50 hours.  If a person is at the same time they're\ndeveloping the application, they are learning the tricks, then that same project will\ntake that person about 50 days.  And so this accounts for the order of magnitude\ndifference in program productivity.  It's not how smart the people are, but how\nfamiliar they are with this specific technology and the tricks that are part of that\ntechnology.\n\nTrickGroups\n\nSo we're going to be looking at seven groups of tricks in our application development.\nThe first set of tricks that we're going to be looking at is how to set up a server.\nThe next set of tricks is about working with data inside your application.  And then\nwe're going to work with views and we're going to work with formatting, getting the\nstyle that you want.  Then we're going to be working with documents in the file system\nand in the database and then we are going to look at user authentication and\nauthorization.  And then we are going to kind of step back and take a look at some\nproject-related tricks, as well.  \n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\n**Server  (5 Tricks)**\n\nServerStart\n\nOkay, we're ready to start our first set of tricks.  So what we want to do is we want\nto set up a Django server that can serve our project needs.  So the first that we need\nto be able to do is we need to be able to run the server application.  So Django ships\nwith a lightweight server that can be used instead of Apache.  When you go to\nproduction, you're definitely going to want to deploy your application on an\nindustrial server, like Apache, but for development purposes, you can spin up with one\nline of code, you can spin up a server and you can test out all your things and be\nable to work with your application.  \n\nSo here what I've done is I've shown you how to get that server running.  There is a\nmanaged script and you just use the script inside of that, called Runserver and now\nall of a sudden, you have your application listening to whatever port you told it to\nlisten to and serving your pages.\n\nWhen you go to production, you're likely to want to deploy that on Apache.  There are\na number of other options that you can use as well, but I deploy most of my Django\napplications on Apache.  And so here's an example of restarting the server remotely\nfrom a development machine.  So all you really need to do is you need to SSH into a\nparticular machine name and then you need to find the restart script in Apache and\njust run it.  And so that one line of code will net you a remote server.  \n\nOkay, the next thing that we want to do now that we're running our server is we want\nto load a web page and check it out.  And so when we're running our development\nserver, it normally starts up on port 8000.  So if you just point Firefox to\nlocalhost:8000 that will load your pages.  That's the first trick, starting the\nserver.  \n\nCreateProject\n\nThe second trick that we want to do is we want to create a new project.  So we're\nready to start our thing, we're ready to start writing code.  There's a set of scripts\nthat are bundled under the Django admin script.  And so if you just type Django admin\nstart project Mystore then it will create a new project for you called Mystore.  And\nwhat you see here in that directory is a number of different files that Django will\ncreate for you, including the glue logic that runs in the web server that allows you\nto answer HTTP requests.  So all that infrastructure is created for you and all you\nneed to do is modify a few basic settings to add your application logic. \n\nHelloWorld\n\nAnd so the next that we do is we see the end of the directory and we run the server\nand then we load the web page.  So now you should have a running web application.  \n\nThe next that we want to do, our application, it runs, but it doesn't do anything and,\nat the very minimum, we want to answer and HTTP request.  And so this is just about\nthe simplest application that you can write.  So here what we do is there is a URLs\nfile that is automatically created for us.  And what we are going to do is we are\ngoing to hook in to that URLs file and give it regular expression that matches the\nHTTP request that is going to be made.  And then we're going to generate a HTTP\nresponse for that.  So we could do all of this in about three lines of code. \n\nInterviewer:\tSo is each one of these slides one trick?  So the one earlier where you\nhad three different blue headers or is that just one trick between the three of them?\n\nRespondent:\tThat's one trick, starting the server and then creating a project, one trick.\nOne trick saying hello world.  \n\n\nOkay, so this code snippet here, if you were to just cut and paste this in or type it\ninto your editor then you test it out, fire it up and within five minutes after you've\nstarted the project, you can at least answer HTTP [inaudible 16:12].  And all you've\nwritten here now is really -- you've executed a couple of shell scripts, but you've\nonly written about four or five lines of Python maybe in total. \n\nCreateApp\n\nIn reality, you don't actually create applications by just hard coding the URLs with\nthe patterns to find.  What you really do is you really create a cluster of\nfunctionality that Django calls an application.  I don't like this particular name\nbecause it feels more like a module to me than an application, but nevertheless that's\nthe vocabulary that Django uses.\n\nAnd so what you're really going to want to do is you're going to want to create what\nDjango calls an app and you're going to give it a name.  So in our example here, we're\ngoing to create an app called Buymore.  And so what we do is we use that managed\nscript again, which really just sets the context for executing Python stuff.  So we do\nstart app Buymore and it creates a whole directory structure for us.  It creates model\ncode, it creates views and it creates kind of a skeleton that we can work with and we\ncan add our application logic.  \n\nHomeView\n\nThe other thing that you need to do is, you need to hook that application in using\nyour settings file that it created for you.  You need to reference your Buymore\napplication as an installed application.  And that will mean that Django will go and\nlook for your model code and your view code and your URLs and all that stuff.  It\nknows that that's an integral part of your application that you're building.  So one\nline of code will basically hook up your application into the settings.  \n\nSo now what we've done is we've created a new app called Buymore inside of our Django\napplication.  Now the next trick that we're going to do is we're actually going to\nwrite a view code that will respond to our HTTP request.  And here what we are doing\nis we're going to handle the URL that is blank so you just hit -- if you just type in\nthe top level website domain then this is the URL that you're going to get and you're\ngoing to get the homepage.  And so in this case, we've created an application that has\nexactly one page that it can respond to.  And we've hard coded an HTTP response that\njust replies Mystore contents for that request.  \n\nInterviewer:\tSo URLs maps things to function [codes]?\n\nRespondent:\tYes, it's a regular expression that it parses the regular expression if it --\nit's a stack of regular expressions typically.  And, as soon as it finds the first one\nthat matches then it binds to your Python code that is located in the Buymore application\nin the views file and then inside of views is a function defined as homepage.  And then we\njust have a hard coded response.\n\nInterviewer:\tSo if you wanted to have a custom 404 not found page, would you just put\n[inaudible 19:59] pattern at the very bottom of your stack?\n\nRespondent:\tYes.\n\nInterviewer:\tSo everything else doesn't match you can send it to the...\n\nRespondent:\tAnd so you can do really fancy handling of 404s and all that kind of stuff.\nAnd then in these responses, you can also redirect.  So when you're -- instead of just\nhard coding a HTTP response, you might want to redirect to some other page if you\ndetermine that a certain situation is needed. \n\nSo now we've been able to create a server, create a project, create an application and\nthen create handlers within that application.  Now what we're going to do is we're\ngoing to figure out how to work with data.  So we haven't worked with any data at all.\nWe had just hard coded everything.  \n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\n**Data (9 Tricks)**\nDataBase\nDataBasePostGres\nNewDataModel\nCreateDatabase\nAddRecord\nSaveRecord\nQueryRecords\nShowResults\nDeleteRecord\n\nThe first thing that you will want to do in your application is you're going to want\nto hook to a database.  And in addition to Django shipping with a lightweight server,\nthey also allow you to hook up to a lightweight database.  And so when you're just\nmessing around when you're creating your application, you can create a database in a\nsingle file and then when you're all done then you can basically deploy that and\nreroute that to a more industrial database.  \n\nSo in this case, what we're going to do is we're going to just hook the sequel\n[inaudible 21:34].  And the only that we need to do with [inaudible 21:38] because it\ndoesn't use any user authentication or anything like that, it's just a vocal file on\nyour file system.  The only thing that we need to do is just name the file.  And so\nwe're going to call this thing Hammer DB.\n\nNow later on, you decide that you really need to use postscripts for example, or\nMysequel or any other kind of database that you fancy.  And so here what we do is we\nhave to name the database and then we have to have database access credentials.  And\nso all we do is just change the name of the connection string that we're going to use\nto mount that database.  \n\nAnd typically on web host environments, the database is not located on the same server\nor often times it's not located on the same server that your web application runs on.\nAnd so, no problem; just put the access credentials for the other server.  So we\nchanged three lines of code and all of a sudden we were able to go from a single file\ndatabase to an industrial database.  \n\nOkay, the next thing that we want to do is we want to define our own data types.  And\nthen we want to take these data types and put them in the database as table types.\nAnd so here what we are going to do is we're going to define a class called Note and\nit's going to have two fields.  It's going to have a title and a body and one is going\nto be a fixed [length string] that can go up to a maximum size of 200 and the body is\njust going to be some indeterminate length of text.  And that's all we have to do.\nThree lines of code and now we have a model that we can use.  You put this model into\nthe model's file in your app so in like the Buymore app, if we put the note in there\nthen it's good to go.  \n\nInterviewer:\tDoes it matter what app your data type is declared under since there's\nmultiple models that.\n\nRespondent:\tIt creates tables that contain both the app name and the model name within\nthat and so if you have customers as an app and, if you have orders as a model within that\nthen the table that is created is called customers underscore order.  \n\nNow we're ready to take that model code and generate a database for us.  So you don't\nactually have to write sequel to create the database formats.  All you really have to\ndo is to find the Python code that accesses the data type and then it controls the\ndatabase for you.  So it will actually generate the database.  And the way you do that\nis to do manage by [sync DB] and then that will create all of the missing data tables\nfor you.  \n\nThis is really awesome because, if you're creating data types all the time, they just\nkeep syncing the database and it creates a bunch of stuff for you.  Once you put data\nin the table, it will not modify the database.  You'll have to do that manually.  And\nthere are some tools to help you with that, but the common case is that you're just\ngoing to create a bunch of data.  I typically recreate the database many, many times\nthroughout projects and I will tend to throw it away.\n\nInterviewer:\tOur experience was that we had to create some migration scripts [in order\nto diminish that pie] for when we change the data type of fields instead of the database.\n\nRespondent:\tCorrect.  There's a couple of other great tools that will allow you to\nside-step sequel.  You can dump all of the data in your database as JSON and then you can\nload it back in and so this is a great thing to do if you just want to mess with the data\nor you just want to write transforms that mess with the data and then put it all back in.  \n\nIt's also a great tool that you can use to actually do queries in a form that maybe\nyou want to send out to a front-end client app and you just want to have a job script\non the front-end that manipulates your data.  What you might want to do is just dump a\nbig [hairy] piece of data right out of your database and then just [hype it] to the\ncustomer or to the front-end app that can manipulate.  \n\nThe next thing we want to do is we want to add a record of a particular type.  So this\nis our old friend, the [Note].  It has a title and a body and to add a record, all you\nneed to do is create a blank object just by calling the initializer for a note, set\nthe fields that you want and then save it.  The save is really smart about how to get\nthe data in the right place and whether you have an exception to the data if you're\nmissing a field or something like that.  And then there are also some additional\nvalidation things.  Save will throw an exception and you might want to handle that\nexception if you're not sure if it's valid or not.  But really nice, one line of code\nbasically just smashes your data in the database.\n\nInterviewer:\tWe were using Get or Create, but this is a lot simpler.\n\nRespondent:\tThe next thing you want to do is you may want to modify an object.  So again,\nhere's our friend the Note.  We just get a note and we reset its body and save it.  So\nthat allows you to modify things that already exist in the database or selectively modify\nfields allows you to -- so really to get here is doing a select and then the save is doing\nan update underneath.  But you don't need to worry about that.  You don't need to worry\nabout whether you have one or don't have one or whatever.  This simple pattern here is\ngreat for saving your data. \n\nInterviewer:\tSo will that give you a new blank object with title equals title?\n\nRespondent:\tNo, it will throw an exception and so there is a version of the [getter] that\nwill\n\nOkay, so the next thing that we want to do is we want to go out and list how many\nobjects match a particular thing.  So the first thing we want to do is just enumerate\nall of the objects in the system of particular types.  So we ask for notes -- we ask\nfor note, objects all and this returns a list of all of the matching notes.  \n\nThe next thing we might want to do is we might want to match a particular title when\nwe're looking for something in the database and so, again, this generates a select\nstatement where the title matches the word lost worlds.  And the last case that we\nmight want to do is something more complicated where we're looking for a string in the\ntitle that is greater than some value or it could be a numeric thing.  \n\nAnd Django gives us a really nice list of modifiers that can be used for matching\ncertain kinds of criteria.  So there's greater than, less than, not equal and you can\ndo things like count how many there are and, if the count is bigger than a number, you\ncan do all kinds of things.  So anyway, the sky is the limit.  There's about 34\ndifferent types of modifiers that you can use.  And you can do date ranges and all\nkinds of things.  There's no reason to write sequel.  If you're a sequel-hater like me\nthen Django gives you all the tools that will let you sidestep that.  \n\nThe next thing that you might want to do is you might want to [iterate] through --\nyou've got this query, you get back a bunch of things and now what you want to do is\nyou want to walk the list and print out all the title of the books or all the titles\nof the notes or whatever it is that your database is holding.  \n\nAnd so here's an example of printing out all the notes and it just prints a model, one\nline each as a title and text and it just gives you a nice table of notes.  And so you\ncould imagine wrapping these kinds of things in text tools to do [inaudible 31:57] and\nbasically manage all of your stuff with automated [inaudible].  This kind of stuff is\njust extremely handy for that.  \n\nA more interesting example is you might want to query the database and give back a\ntable of notes and then apply formatting to that because you might want to have your\nweb page, for example, create a table for you.  And what you need is you need a\ntwo-dimensional list of items that then you want to populate in a table.  What this\nallows you to do is a set of generic views, like a table pager that knows nothing\nabout the data that it's holding, but it controls all of the formatting stuff.  \n\nAnd then underneath you have a query function that can generate a table out of the\ncontents that you want to look up, but you don't have any idea how you want to format\nthis.  So this is what we call in the software industry, separation of concerns.  So\nthe formatting of the table is completely independent of the populating of the data in\nthe table.  So here's an example of getting a table out of a database.  One line a\ncode, really nice\n\nThe next thing you might want to do to close out our set of [inaudible 33:38]\noperations is you might want to delete a record.  And so here I've given three\nexamples deleting everything in the database or deleting things that match a specific\ncriteria or a more complicated set of matches and these are essentially the matches\nthat we had before.  So once you've learned these set of operations of how to query\nand how to select certain things then everything that you expect scales out and you\ncan apply any operations.  And here all we're doing is just calling the delete\n[member] function on the \n\nInterviewer:\tSo will this delete underscore note just delete the first entry [inaudible\n34:24].\n\nRespondent:\t[inaudible].  Yes, get only returns one.  Filter returns many.  And that's why\nwe have to iterate the filter list.  This one will actually blow up or throw an exception\nif there is no matching -- the get operation will throw an exception if there is no\nmatching object.\n\nInterviewer:\tBut if there's more than one note with lost worlds as the title it will it\nonly delete the first one? \n\nRespondent:\tGet will have problems with that and so you would use a variant of filter if\nyou thought that there were multiple ones.\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\n**Views (7 Tricks)**\nHomeView\nListViewUrl\nListView\nDetailsView\nFormModel\nAddRecordView\nEditView\nDeleteView\n\nSo now we have the ability to create an application.  We have the ability to\nmanipulate data within that application.  The next set of tricks that we're going to\nexplore is how to build views in our system because after all, we want to build a\nweb-based system and one of the key parts of that is building our views.  \n\nNow these views can be HTML-generated or they could be maybe XML or JSON in the formal\nweb service thing.  I build a lot of web services where you basically can query URLs\nand then have the rendering not be intended for human view, but is just a blob of JSON\ndata that you might want to put on your cell phone or do something like that.  So this\nworks both for front-end services as well as back-end services.  \n\nSo the next that we're going to do is we're going to revisit our friend the home view\nand here what we're doing is we're matching the regular expression that is the\n[inaudible 36:26] string, the beginning and end of line together.  The URL parser has\nthis regular expression language.  It's kind of some nasty syntax, but once you spend\nmaybe an hour trying to figure out how it works, it's not that hard, but when you're\nreading it for the first time, it's kind of offensive, but you'll get used to it.  \n\nSo here we have our old friend the view that we just hard coded to return my store\ncontents.  The next thing that we're going to want to do is we're going to want to\nhave a list of items that we are going to want to display.  And so here we're parsing\nout in addition to the home page, we're parsing out the list URL and mapping that to\nthe Python function list page.  \n\nHere's the implementation of the list page thing.  And this is very typical of the\nkind of thing that you will see is that the function it calls some Python function,\nwhich generates a list of items and then it puts that in a variable called products\nand then it loads a template and the template is a bunch of HTML code that's augmented\nwith some Pythony-stuff, so that I can manipulate the data inside my Python views.  \n\nSo our template here is going to iterate over each of the things in the products list.\nIt's going to call each one P and then it is going to print the label of P both as the\nHREF of the anchor as well as the text that gets displayed to a user.  So what you end\nup with after this runs is a bullet list of all of the products that are linked to the\nindividual pages for those products.  \n\nOkay, the next thing that we want to do is we want to create a details view.  So we\nhave a list of hyperlinks that link to each of the pages for each of our products and\nnow what we want to do is we want to pick of each of the individual products.  And so\nhere we see a more complex syntax for parsing off the argument that's the product ID\nthat we want to display. \n\nAnd so that will be passed into the view, which is called item.  So we have a function\ncalled item and it takes a request and an ID.  And that ID is the variable that got\nparsed off in the URL pattern.  So presumably it's -- and, in fact, it says that it's\na series of digits.  So you're going to say URL with a domain name slash 33 and that's\ngoing to map to an item call in the views [code].  \n\nThen the template that is being used to display this details view is called details\ndot HTML.  And so, in this case, we are passing the ID of the product, which is a --\nI'm rewording this.  Just a minute. \n\nHere what we do is we look up the specific product object out of the database and then\nwe pass that object into the template and then, inside the template, we crack it open\nand we print its primary key, its title, its description or when there were other\nfields it has.  And so this is typical of Django views that there's typically a very\nsmall amount of code that deals with the object types that are being used.  But you\ncan imbed some Python code in the template itself to handle special cases. \n\nOkay, the next thing that we want to do, and I have to say that this is probably the\nmost complicated thing that I'm going to show.  And this is form editing.  And so here\nwhat we're going to do is we're going to pass back data to our view from user input\nand there's several parts to this.  The first part is that we define a form that knows\nwhat edit fields and things like that, that knows what UI to put on our template so\nthat we don't have to write the code that enumerates all of the contents of the class\nthat we want to edit. \n\nSo instead what we do is we define a note form and that note form references the\nactual object type and so it knows that it needs to create a text field for that first\n-- or it needs to create an input field for that first path field in the object type.\nAnd then for the body, it needs to create a text area to match the data type.  And so\nwhat happens is a form comes up on the user interface just that is consistent with the\n-- that is consistent with the object type and we didn't have to define any of the UI\nelements for our specific data type.  All we had to do was create a form that\nreferences the underlying data type. \n\nOkay, in the template part of this, we use this called Form S Table and that is the\nthing that figures out what UI elements need to be present to edit that particular\nkind of a thing.  And the other nasty piece is this cross-site reference and it is --\nI'm going to ignore that for now, but you have to have this to prevent somebody from\ninvoking your form from another website.  This verifies that the creator of this form\nis a legitimate service.\n\nOkay, so we've created the surface area of our form.  Now what we're going to do is\nwe're going to populate this form with data and then we're going to accept that data\nback after the user has typed in the title and body of their note.  And so here what\nyou see is a typical construct where we're using a post-back and there are three cases\nthat we need to handle in our forms.\n\nThe first case is that we have a blank form that we want to present to the user.  And\nso we're adding an element, we're adding a data type to our database and so we put up\na blank form.  The second case is that we have a post-back and the data is good.  And\nthen the third case is that we have a post-back and the data is not good.  It will not\nvalidate and so we can't put it into the database.  And if you analyze this piece of\ncode here, it handles all three of those cases.  In the case where we have valid data\nthen we redirect to the home page and so you could put any redirects in there.  \n\nOkay, now this is the super complicated case because now we have data that we're going\nto put in the form with, by looking up an object in the database.  So they're trying\nto edit note number 33 and so we actually can look up note number 33, put the data\ninto the note then give it back to the user.\n\nInterviewer:\tAs an editable form. \n\nRespondent:\tAs an editable form.  Then when they edit that, then we have the other two\ncases for the post-back that we either have valid or invalid data.  And so this particular\nform handles all of those paths.  \n\nOkay, glad we're through that.  Now for more easy stuff.  We're going to delete based\non accessing a URL.  So here what we need to do is we need to figure out exactly what\nitem we're trying to delete from the database and then just map that to a delete view.\nInside the delete view, what we do is we look up the particular object in the database\nand then we just call its delete function if we found it.  If we didn't find it, we\nprobably don't want to blow up the program. \n\nAnd then, in either case, we're going to redirect to the home view because we just\ndeleted something out of the table.  This could be -- this is typically a list of\nitems and you're going to delete them out of a table of a list and so that's usually\nwhat the code looks like.  And then this, in our list view, I've given a snippet of an\nanchor that will get you that URL.  And so this is an example of how you might put\nthat into your table. \n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\n**Formatting (4 Tricks)**\nPageLayout\nPageTemplate\nStandardNavigation\nJsSupport\n\nOkay, now we're through views.  So we've created our application, we've manipulated\ndata, we've built a set of views.  And so those are all operations that you need to be\nable to work with data in a typical website.  Now what we're going to do is we're\ngoing to style our website.  \n\nOne really nice thing that Django provides is the ability to declare a template that\ncan be used by other templates to set your page styling so you can control the styling\nof your entire website from modifying your single base template.  So in this case,\nI've created a template called layout, not HTML and there's a couple of things that\nyou would typically want to do.  One is I like to use Twitter Bootstrap in all my\nprojects and this gives the site an instant styling without putting any effort into\nit.  And so here, what I've done is I've just imbedded the libraries, the library\nreferences to Twitter Bootstrap right here on my base page and then all the other\npages get it for free.  \n\nThe other thing that you typically do is you have some area of content that you want\neach page to override.  And so Django gives you the ability to define blocks and then\na default handling of those blocks.  So if in the inside of this block here, this\nblock content, I provided a bunch of HTML and then the page that extends this layout,\nif it doesn't redefine that HTML, if it doesn't provide its own version of that block\nthen you get the default.  So that's kind of nice for having some default behavior\nlike no content goes here or something like that.  It's a handy way to do that.  \n\nOkay and then this is a trick where we're going to extend that template and utilize\nthat in the context of our project.  And so here what we've done is we've defined a\nblock content, which has a title on each one and then it has an unordered list of\nitems for a number of different directories or a number of different files.  So this\nis basically -- this construct appears in every program that I've ever written because\nsomewhere in there, you're going to deal with a list of stuff and so this is basically\nhow you walk the list and paint all the references. \n\nAnd you can see that each one of those individual references then is an anchor with an\nHREF and text that match the content of the directory listing.  And so basically,\nyou're just passing on a list of items and then they get painted by a few lines of\ncode like that.  So that kind of construct you'll see in almost every application your\nwrite. \n\nOkay, another nice thing that this allows us to do is to define our site level\nnavigation.  And so here what I've done is I've used the Twitter Bootstrap nav bar for\ncreating a set of links that I want to have specific kinds of information.  And so\nthis kind of a construct would appear in your layout HTML and then every page would\nautomatically get that without redefining that construct.  So this gives you one place\nto define things.  It makes your code really clean. \n\nAnother thing that you might want to do is you might want to provide some front-end\njob script manipulation.  So in this case what I've done is just referenced a [J]\nquery library and then I don't really have to do anything else and now all of a sudden\nI can manipulate front-end objects in all my pages if this were in the base page. \n\nOkay, now we've got styling in our application.  The next thing that we need to work\non is getting documents.  \n\nInterviewer:\tWe're doing this as [inaudible 53:01] can be really nice if you show what\nthe applets look like so far. \n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\n**Document (6 Tricks)**\nBrowseDirectory\nReadFile\nWriteFile\nExecuteScript\nTextToHtml\nSearchText\n\nRespondent:\tOkay now we're going to work on a set of tricks dealing with manipulating\ndocuments.  The first thing that I always do when I learn a new programming language is I\nalways figure out how to be able to walk the file system because I often need to\nmanipulate either directories or files in the file system.  And so this is one of the\nfirst things that I always need to do.  \n\nAnd so here we see an example of a directory listing where we give the directory name\non the URL.  We map that to a function in the views code called list view and then,\ninside list view, we take in that path name that came in through the URL and we go out\nand enumerate the contents of that particular directory, stick it in a Python variable\ncalled files, hand it off to our template, who knows how to paint a list of files.  So\nin roughly less than 10 lines of code, we have now created a file listing interface to\nour application.  \n\nOkay, the next thing that we're going to want to do is we're going to want to open one\nof those files and reading all the text.  And so here's an example of how you would\nwant to do that.  We take in the URL that names the file, we map that URL to a\nfunction called read view in the views [class].  Then inside of read view, we open the\ncontents of that path and then we read all of the characters out of that and we stick\nit in a variable called text.  And then we have a template that we just hand text to\nand it paints all that.  So here we have roughly six lines of code and we have the\nability to display a file in HTML, assuming the file is HTML. \n\nWriting is just about the same and here what we've done is we have created a log\nfunction so that every time I hit a page, I want to record the fact that I hit that\npage.  And so I've created a function called log that I can imbed in all of my\ndifferent views that will keep a history of page hits in a text file on my machine.\nAnd the way it does that is it appends to a file and it formats the date of the hit\nand then which user was logged in and then the name of the page that they were\nhitting.  So that's all imbedded in this log function.  \n\nAnd then I could use that log function in any view that -- just to create a passive\nlogger so that I can get a history of all of the activity on my website.  So you don't\nnecessarily need to imbed a heavyweight logging tool, you can just build your own\nlogging in roughly four or five lines of code. \n\nInterviewer:\tSo how does this get then passed on to the page that you're requesting\nbecause I though URLs only looked for the first match on the regular expression. \n\nRespondent:\tThis URL is going to map to the record view thing and then record view is just\ngoing to return home.  In fact, its on -- this is basically going to double hop your\nthing.  Its not actually going to do anything useful.  It's just going to redirect to some\nother page.  But what I was really trying to illustrate is not the handler for that, but\nhow easy it is to imbed logging in other views.  Presumably you have some more interesting\nlogic that you want, but in just a few lines of code, you could write a custom logger. \n\nInterviewer:\tOkay.  You're not demonstrating how to double intercept.  \n\nRespondent:\tCorrect.  Okay, the next thing that we might want to do is we might want to\nexecute shell commands.  In this example, what I've done is I've allowed certain scripts\nto be run and I look up those scripts and I execute them because they are shell scripts.  \n\nAnd so here what I'm doing is I'm taking in URLs where the command is a part of the\nURL name and then I'm executing the file using this [P] open and giving it -- I'm\nsupplying the command name and then I'm taking all of its output and passing it back\nto the [caller].  And so here what I'm doing is I'm actually invoking some command and\nthen I'm going to create a page that shows both the command and the result of\nexecuting that command.  Again, very few lines of code and its the magic of Python\nthat's really giving us this huge leverage factor.  \n\nAnother thing that I typically do in virtually all the programs that I write is I want\nto do some formatting and I have some fairly sophisticated tools that deal with things\nlike wiki formatting and extracting hyperlinks and maybe I want to write some tools\nthat actually do some remote lookups and maybe do some command execution or whatever. \n\nSo typically what I have is I have all my pages go through a command that can be\narbitrarily sophisticated and has nothing to do with the web infrastructure.  So I ran\nmy websites so that they deal with web pages and URLs in all of the infrastructure\nabout dealing with the web, I concentrate in one, but all my business logic, I have\nisolated in worker functions that may have a different lifecycle than the rest of the\napplication.  \n\nAnd so here's an example of that type of a thing.  The way that I paint a document on\nthe screen is I call this function format document that may do a bunch of arbitrary\nthings and one of the things that it may do is invoke an external program that does a\nbunch of stuff that my web system knows nothing about.  What it does know is that, by\nthe time this wiki HTML format command is done, its going to produce a block of output\nand then I'm going to pass that block of output onto the web page for display.  \n\nBut this allows you to build a system that is very, very decoupled and so that you can\nchange your business rules and it has zero impact on your web base infrastructure,\nvery important for the long life of the system. \n\nAnother thing that's really handy to do is you might want to search all the objects in\nyour database for a particular piece of text.  And so here's just a simple example of\ngetting all the filters -- getting all of the objects by filtering them, based on\nwhether the name contains the word, Bill.  And so this one thing will give you all the\nBills in the system and then that's being passed on to the template as a variable\ncalled people.  \n\n**Users (7 Tricks)**\nAdminImage\nAdminInterface\nUserLogin\nEnforcingSecurity\nDetailsImage\nEditUser\nListUsers\n\nOkay, now we have built an application, we've been able to work with data, we've been\nable to work with views, construct views, we've been able to style those views and now\nwe've been able to manipulate the underlying file system and work with documents. \n\nNow we're ready to work with user authentication.  There's really two parts that we\nwant to do.  The first is that we want to authorize a particular user.  We want to --\nthere's two parts to working with users.  The first part is to authenticate that a\nparticular -- that we know who a particular user is.  The second part is to allow them\na certain level of privilege and that's called authorization.\n\nDjango provides both of these facilities with great ease.  In about two lines of code,\nyou can enable a whole user auth system that has amazingly good capabilities; very\nnice, secure, robust, easy to implement and turn on.  And I highly recommend not\nbuilding your own user authentication system, but just enabling the one that is\nprovided to you.  \n\nAt its base level, it gives you a number of objects that you have a nice user\ninterface too so you can manage the users in your system.  And this is how you turn on\nthe user auth system.  The first thing that you need to do is include the access to\nthe import libraries and then the next thing that you need to do is tell Django that\nyou're using the built-in authentication system and then the last thing that you need\nto do is you need to map all the URLs that start with admin to be handled by the\nbuilt-in library.  That's all you need to do.  So all you're really telling it is\nevery time somebody types in a URL that starts with admin, it must be for you and then\nyou get all this user interface for free.  \n\nHere's an example of adding login and logout to your application.  So here what we're\ndoing is we're picking off the login and logout URLs and then we just map them to the\ndefault handling of those same functions.  So we don't actually have to provide any\nuser interface or anything and all of the business rules about what happened with a\nfailed login and resetting my password and I forgot my password and email me so that I\ncan get a reset link, all of that stuff is done for you.  You don't have to do any\nwork to do that. \n\nOkay, this is an example of the authorization piece.  Here what we're doing is we're\ngoing to require that, if you hit the home page that you have to be logged in in order\nto see the home page.  And what that decorator does, the login required decorator is\nthat, if you are not authenticated when you hit the home page, you'll be mapped\nautomatically.  You'll be redirected to the login screen.  Again, one line of code and\nnow all of a sudden, we have checking. \n\nAnd so you can have certain views that can be universally accessed, but you add the\nlogin required decorator anyplace in your system where you decide that you want to\ncontrol permissions.  And there are a number of other decorators' variations on this\nthat allow you to -- only allow super users to have access to this or only require a\nspecific user or user group privileges to be able to do certain things. \n\nOne of the things that I love about Django is that easy things are easy and hard\nthings are possible and that's the right combination.  Easy things should be trivial.  \n\nOkay now what we're going to do here is we are going to be able to look at not only\nall of the built-in types that Django has that they have offered for us that they\nautomatically put in our database, but we are wanting to get nice customized views of\nour specific data types.  So for example, the note thing that we created, once we've\ncreated that data type, now we can edit that data type, automatically writing zero\nadditional code. \n\nSome of the data types for the built-in things are really sophisticated.  For example,\nyou can see in this edit box for the user that they have [salting] of the passwords\nand they have the forgot my password thing and there's a whole bunch of business\nlogic.  There's probably thousands of lines of code implementing business logic that\nyou have no business re-implementing yourself when a team of experts did that for you.  \n\nAnd then another nice thing is that any tables can be shown as a list and so that you\ncan drill down in and you can look at all of the fields across all of your different\ndata types, which is built-in user interface stuff, again, writing no code at all.\nAll you did was hook up the admin interface. \n\nOkay, so now we've got user authentication in our system and we've written about five\nlines of code total to get all of these rough indication stuff looked up.  It also\nsaved us many, many hours, maybe a month's worth of hard work. \n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\n**Project (5 Tricks)**\nTricksInventory\nEstimateCost\nTestDrivenDevelopment\nHostYourApp\nDeployApp\n\nOkay now the last set of tricks that we're going to look at is some global project\nmanagement tricks.  And this kind of takes advantage of the capabilities of Django,\nbut is not necessarily specific to Django.  \n\nThe first trick that I recommend is that you analyze your next project and you\nactually do an inventory of all of the tricks that you're going to need.  Then you're\ngoing to -- and many times when people first start analyzing a project, they end up\nwith big tasks that need to be done.  I would say break those tasks down until you can\nget down to the level of identifying specific tricks.  And so you want to keep\ndecomposing until you feel like I can do this in an hour if I knew the trick.  \n\nThen do an inventory of how many times you've used that trick already.  If you've\napplied a specific trick five or six times, it will probably only take you an hour.\nBut if you've never done that trick before then you have to factor in both the\nlearning, as well as the doing.\n\nInterviewer:\tIts probably a day.\n\n\nRespondent:\tIt will probably take you a day the first time and every time you do a trick,\nyou can cut that time in half, down to about an hour.  So then you can estimate the\ncost just by rolling those things out.  You can take how many tricks that you've got,\nfigure out how many tricks you already know.  You can apply a trick in an hour, learn\nthe trick in a day.  So that gives you a really accurate estimate.  \n\nSo this is a typical project that I work on is that it has 50 tricks.  I know 40 of\nthem.  So it's going to take me about 40 hours to apply the tricks I already know.\nBut there's 10 tricks that I don't know yet.  Those 10 tricks are going to take me\ntwice the amount of time as the 40 tricks that I already know and that's typical of a\nproject.  So what this says is that two-thirds of my time spent on this project is\ngoing to be learning what I don't know already.  \n\nThe next thing that I highly recommend is use test-driven development.  Accelerate\nyour project by creating a process of rapid iteration.  And when I mean rapid, I think\nyou should be able to add a new feature every five minutes.  And so what you want to\nfind is how to create on line of code to add a new feature and to create one line of\ncode to add a new test and then what you want to do is you want to write your test\nbefore you write your code.  \n\nThis is not hard because you're only writing one line of test code and then you're writing\none line of product code and you should be able to turn that wheel in about five minutes.\nTest hourly,daily and weekly at different levels of depth and then deploy all of your code\nonly when the testpassed.  There's no point in deploying bad code.  And, if you haven't\ntested it, it is bad code.\n\nSo the next thing is host your web application.  The first time that you have to host\nan application, it will probably take about a day.  And after that, you can probably\ndeploy your app in an hour.  While I like a web host called WebFaction, they have very\ncheap sites and you can set them up and get going very quickly.  They have control\npanel, operations that allow you to set up the URLs and map them and they create a\nstatic server for you to serve up your images and JavaScript libraries and thingslike\nthat.  And so it's a largely point-and-click and then they allow you to bind yourweb\napplication to specific domains.  One of the tricks that I like is I have many\ndifferent domains serve off the same web application.  So I have one app thatserves\nprobably 20 different domains.\n\nThe next thing that you want to do is you want to deploy your application.  So I\nreally like a tool called Get that allows me to create a new repository by calling\n[Getanet] to check-in everything that's been modified, added or deleted, with one\ncommand, where you get commit.  And then I can push my application to share with the\nrepository or any other people that are using that repository with a single command\ncode get push and then I can do that remotely.  I can redeploy my application by just\ndoing SSA [inaudible 01:15:36] get pull. \n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\n**Follow Up**\nSourceCode\nHelpMe\nDjangoDocs\nRelatedTopics\n\nAll of the source code that I've showed is on my GitHub repository and the slide\npresentation is located on my website.

Everyone in the room started to murmur and Stacie\nand I started to argue loudly.  Suddenly an episode of Amazing Race\nbroke out.\n\nI was so frustrated that I yanked the mouse out of the computer and\nthrew it across the room.  This immeditately seemed like it was a\nmistake so I went searching through the crowd to see if anyone had\nseen my mouse that had gone missing recently.  It was nowhere to be\nfound.\n\nMeanwhile the meeting had completely stopped and I felt a little\nresponsible. Fortunatey the next thing that happened was me waking\nup.

moments of clarity.  This often happens when we are going along\nand minding our own business, which is really another way of saying ignoring God. Then we suddenly\nbecome aware of how the Lord has been working in our lives.\n\nThis can be a dramatic experience, like Paul going to Damascus, or a more subtle one, such as John\nWesley feeling \"strangely warmed\".  Either way this is a powerful emotional experience for us.  This\nbecome a reference point, as we think about our relationship with God.\n\nWe are not always aware of his presence in our lives. The problem is on our side not his.  Life is\nfilled with turmoil, business, relationships, losses and triumphs.  We are often led by fear and\npride. Both make us feel alienated from God.\n\nThen, often in the midst of confusion, God shows up.  We suddenly see everything differently.  He\nshow us how one core assumption is invalid and we spend months trying to understand the full\nimplications of that.\n\nIn the bible, people would often build memorials to commemorate these events.  This is a good idea\nfor us too.  Place something in your daily life that symbolizes the emotional significance of an\nencounter with God.\n\nThe specific experience that you have at a turning point will not last.  But there is an residual\neffect that leaves us changed. Later in the business of life, we still recall the moment when we\ncaught a glimpse of the glory of God.\n\nGrab a hold of these moments and savor them.  Create reminders that will take you back to that time\nwhen you felt the Lord's presence the most.  He is longing for us to feel closer to him.  Use that\nmemory to create more time seeking his closeness.\n\nIn the presence of God, every daily struggle seems less critical.  This lesson is the most important\nthing that we learn in the turning point.\n\nSee also PrayerPractices\n\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Turning Point"}}, {"pk": 663, "model": "doc.doc", "fields":

Sit down and describe your ideal life\nsituation of three years from now.  This is not a plan but a target.\nWhat would you life your life to be like in three years?\n\nWhy three years?  It is close enough that it demands immediate\naction. But there is also enough time to accomplish something\nmeaningful. A five year goal may not be very realistic because there\nis a feeling that anything in possible.  A one year goal, on the other\nhand, is so immediate that it is not possible to dream.\n\nThree years is enough time to create meaningful change.  The question\nis, \"What direction do you want the change to be in?\".  This should be\nan expression of your values.  What things drive you at your core?\n\nAt this point in my life I value autonomy, mastery, and purpose.\nThese three core values were first articulated for me in the book\n\"Drive\", by Daniel Pink.  But they have resonated with me for a long time.\n\nA target for my life three years from now, would need to embrace all\nthree of these dimensions. Before describing the ideal situation,\nlet's explore each of these three dimensions.\n\n**Autonomy**\n\nFor much of my life I had to work to meet the expectations of others.\nThis was a natural consequence of having responsibility for the\nwelfare of my family.  Now that they are grown I am able to take on\nmore professional risks.\n\nI have also spent thirty years building technical experience and\nfinancial strength to weather the inevitable turmoil to come.  Life is\nwhat happens when you are busy making other plans.\n\nHaving consistently invested for three decades has put me in a strong\nbargaining position from a career, financial, and relational\nviewpoint.  Now it is time to experience the benefit of that.\n\nI want a life situation that lets me choose what I work on, when I\nwork, and who I work with.  I love thinking about projects and intend\nto work hard on them.  But this must be internally motivated rather\nthan forced by the expectations of others.\n\nI have worked hard to achieve this position, and now I am already in a\nposition to control the terms of by career.  The biggest challenge\nfor me is to not sell this freedom for some other benefit.\n\n**Mastery**\n\nI see myself as an inventor, software developer, and author.  From\nchildhood I have been fascinated by inventing things.  I love learning\nand teaching others.  My whole adult life has been a quest for\nachieving mastery of the process of developing software.\n\nOver the last few years, I have been making more time to write.\nReading is a very important part of my life.  I have the largest\npersonal library of anyone I know.  As I learn more I feel compelled\nto pass that knowledge on to others.\n\nOver the last few years I have begun to develop daily practices of\nwriting. I have been learning more about the process of writing and\nhow to tell a good story.  Someday I hope to be a strong writer with a\nfollowing of people who anticipate the next update.\n\nI love computers (except when they break).  Software development is an\nintensely human activity.  It is a chance to create an entire world\ninside of a computer.  I have been very fascinated by the mechanics of\nthe process of software creation.  I want to thoroughly understand and\nteach what makes great software.\n\n**Purpose**\n\nI think that purpose is about serving others.  It is about meeting the\nneeds of someone else.  Sure we have to meet our own needs but that is\nnot enough.  We each must have a feeling that we are producing more\nthan we are consuming.\n\nAt the end of my life I must be able to point to my career and see\nthat I contributed much more than I was ever paid.  I must be able to\nlook at the lives of the people that loved me most and realize that\ntheir lives were much fuller for knowing me.\n\nFinally purpose for me is about knowing that I have changed the\nworld. I need to know that things that I have said have been heard,\nand that things that I have done have made a difference.\n\nThis comes to the issue of influence.  Have I led others to a deeper\nunderstanding of truth?  Are others inspired by my example to a\ngreater level of sacrifice?  These are the questions that cause me to\nlay awake at night.\n", "user": 3, "title": "My Perfect Life"}}, {"pk": 671, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/FilterMapReduce", "text": "* Filter, Map, Reduce *                 -*-muse-*-\n\n**Filter**\n\nfilter(function, sequence) returns a sequence (of the same type, if\npossible) consisting of those items from the sequence for which\nfunction(item) is true. For example, to compute some primes:\n\n        >>> filter(lambda x: x%2 != 0 and x%3 != 0, range(2, 25))\n        [5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23]\n        >>>\n\n**Map**\n\nmap(function, sequence) calls function(item) for each of the\nsequence's items and returns a list of the return values. For example,\nto compute some cubes:\n\n        >>> map(lambda x: x*x*x, range(1, 11))\n        [1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343, 512, 729, 1000]\n        >>>\n\nMore than one sequence may be passed; the function must then have as\nmany arguments as there are sequences and is called with the\ncorresponding item from each sequence (or None if some sequence is\nshorter than another). If None is passed for the function, a function\nreturning its argument(s) is substituted.\n\nCombining these two special cases, we see that map(None, list1, list2)\nis a convenient way of turning a pair of lists into a list of\npairs. For example:\n\n        >>> seq = range(8)\n        >>> map(None, seq, map(lambda x: x*x, seq))\n        [(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 4), (3, 9), (4, 16), (5, 25), (6, 36), (7, 49)]\n        >>>\n\n\n**Reduce**\n\nreduce(function, sequence) returns a single value constructed by\ncalling the (binary) function on the first two items of the sequence,\nthen on the result and the next item, and so on. For example, to\ncompute the sum of the numbers 1 through 10:\n\n        >>> reduce(lambda x, y: x+y, range(1, 11))\n        55\n        >>>\n\nIf there's only one item in the sequence, its value is returned; if\nthe sequence is empty, an exception is raised.\n\nA third argument can be passed to indicate the starting value. In this\ncase the starting value is returned for an empty sequence, and the\nfunction is first applied to the starting value and the first sequence\nitem, then to the result and the next item, and so on. For example,\n\n        >>> def sum(seq):\n        ...     return reduce(lambda x, y: x+y, seq, 0)\n        ... \n        >>> sum(range(1, 11))\n        55\n        >>> sum([])\n        0\n        >>>\n\nSee also PythonTricks\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Filter, Map, Reduce"}}, {"pk": 672, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/EBookPublishing", "text": "* eBook Publishing *                 -*-muse-*-\n\nAttended the eBook publishing seminar on 11-18-2011\n\n**Resources**\n\nUpcoming course on ebooks\nhttp://docs.google.com/document/d/1yxb-A_XMSc4rY5OWFZnUgzw1-SvYkJmcbDCWuJr9OR0/preview?pli=1&sle=true\n\nThe Idea Virus (pdf) - Seth Godin \n\nInterview with Seth Godin  - http://zenhabits.net/seth/\n\nA-List Blogging Bootcamps\nhttp://www.alistbloggingbootcamps.com/ebook-mastery/\n\nHow to sell stuff online\nhttp://e-junkie.com\n\nHow to publish a Kindle book\nKindlePublishing\n\nFree photos\nhttp://www.photoshopsupport.com/resources/stock-photos.html\n\nhttp://odesk.com\nhttp://zenhabits.net/open-source-blogging-feel-free-to-steal-my-content/\n\nhttp://peacefulplanetcommunication.com/how-may-i-help-you/\n\nhttp://www.problogger.net/\n\n\nhttp://momentumgathering.com/\n\n\nhttp://ebookarchitects.com/\n\n\nSee also [[Brain]]\n", "user": 3, "title": "eBook Publishing"}}, {"pk": 673, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/WhyProjectsFail", "text": "* Why Projects Fail *                 -*-muse-*-\n\n**Why projects fail** - Conduct a self-evaluation\nBig bang thinking (all of nothing)\nDesire for magic  (searching for a silver bullet)\nLive for today    (short-term thinking)\nAssume it works   (trust but verify)\n\nCritical decision are made too early\nScope control is everything\nInappropriate tools\nPoor testing\n\nSee also WorldClassSoftware\n\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Why Projects Fail"}}, {"pk": 674, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/WebResources", "text": "* Web Resources *                 -*-muse-*-\n\n**Resources to explore**\nkickstarter.com\nfreebase.com\nalistapart\n\n**Blogs**\nA-list bloggers\nWrite to Done\n\nSee also [[Ideas]]\n\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Web Resources"}}, {"pk": 675, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/Time", "text": "* Time *                 -*-muse-*-\nAccounting for time - Best practices\n\n[[Activities]]\nAnnualBudget\nAnnualTime\nBasicTimeBudget\n[[Calendar]]\nLiesureActivities\nLifeBudget\nLifeBudgetSummary\nOverallBudget\nPrayerTime\n[[Spending]]\nTimeBudget\nTimeByWeek\nTimeOnTask\nTimeSpentMonitor\nTimeToThink\nWeeklyTime\nWeeklyActivities\n", "user": 3, "title": "Time"}}, {"pk": 676, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/SendHtml", "text": "* Send Html *                 -*-muse-*-\n\nThis text is the body of an email message received at gmail.\n\n\n\n<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n<html xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" lang=\"\" xml:lang=\"\" \n    >\n<head>\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=EmulateIE7\" />\n    <title>\n     Thinking  - * Shrinking World Solutions *\n</title>\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" \n          href=\"http://shrinking-world.org/media/admin/css/base.css\" />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"http://shrinking-world.org/media/mybook/css/shrinking-world.css\" />\n    \n    <!--[if lte IE 7]>\n        <link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" \n            href=\"http://shrinking-world.org/media/admin/css/ie.css\" />\n        <![endif]\n    -->\n    \n    \n    <meta name=\"robots\" content=\"NONE,NOARCHIVE\" />\n        <!-- Update your html tag to include the itemscope and itemtype attributes -->\n    <html itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Blog\">\n\n      <!-- Add the following three tags inside head -->\n      <meta itemprop=\"name\" content=\"Seaman's Log\">\n      <meta itemprop=\"description\" content=\"Helping you thrive in the modern world.\">\n      <meta itemprop=\"image\" content=\"http://markseaman.org/media/mybook/images/Mark.Seaman.200.jpg\">\n</head>\n\n\n<body class=\"\">\n  <div id=\"fb-root\"></div>\n  <script>(function(d, s, id) {\n    var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n    if (d.getElementById(id)) return;\n    js = d.createElement(s);

Some people are naturally good \n         \n              at think through problems and coming up with great solutions.  Here are a few patterns that can help \n         \n              you in thinking better. \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              <b>List limit of 9 items</b> \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              Psychological studies have shown that people can only retain up to nine \n         \n              items in short-term memory.  This means that any list where you expect a selection ony works up to \n         \n              nine items.  Longer lists should be broken into multiple selection lists.  A reasonable list should \n         \n              have five or more items to be useful.  Nesting can be used to handle more complicated scenarios. \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              <b>Minimize mindshare</b> \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              Some things we can control and other things we cannot.  Try to make your \n         \n              circle of influence match your circle of concern.  Decrease the amount of mental energy that you \n         \n              invest in areas where you have little influence.  Save your energy for the things that you can \n         \n              change. \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              <b>Eliminate multitasking</b> \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              Your worst enemy is multiple tasks interrupting each other. Focus on one \n         \n              activity as much as possible until it is completed.  Then go on to the next with equal focus.  It \n         \n              is very easy for us to spend as much as 50% of our overall time just switching between multiple \n         \n              tasks.  This has become especially bad in our modern world.  Most people underestimate the cost of \n         \n              multitasking. \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              <b>Scheduled thinking</b> \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              Consider having a block of time scheduled to think through problems. \n         \n              Imagine knowing that you could just file that issue away for 3:00 Thursday.  I recommend that you \n         \n              perform this think time in a location where you cannot be interrupted.  Start with one hour per \n         \n              week.  You are likely to find that you need more time, and that it is easily justified by the \n         \n              return that you get. \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              <b>Think before you leap</b> \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              When confronted with a big decision consider taking both paths.  Imagine \n         \n              trying to live with each of the alternatives.  Which one seems to carry the least risk?  Which is \n         \n              better in the short term or in the long term?  What problem might surface?  What does your \n         \n              intuition tell you? \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              <b>Brainstorm/organize</b> \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              A great way to work out problems is to brainstorm.  This typically involves \n         \n              making a list of various ideas or impression.  During a brainstorm try to postpone judgment.  Once \n         \n              you have captured a bunch of ideas you can work on grouping things together.  This is the time to \n         \n              apply some judgment and pruning. \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              <b>Four by four analysis</b> \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              In order to think through, a topic try this technique. Break your main \n         \n              topic into four roughly equal topics.  Then decompose each of them into four more topics.  I found \n         \n              that this technique is remarkably useful to help me see the interesting aspects of almost any \n         \n              subject. It gives you twenty one statements that have both breadth and depth that can be explored later. \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              <b>Work on only one thing</b> \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              Select a single task that will be the most satisfying to have done. \n         \n              Postpone distractions until this task is complete. By selecting this task you are saying that this \n         \n              is the most important thing that you could do right now.  If you feel that a legitimate \n         \n              interruption is likely then limit the scope of your task to complete it sooner. Then you can focus \n         \n              on another task when needed. \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              <b>Use tools that preserve context</b> \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              Don't have multiple windows up on your computer (each vying for \n         \n              your attention). When you run an application, make the window take the full screen. Finish one \n         \n              thought before going on the next.  Turn off email notification, and check it between tasks.  If you \n         \n              don't control your tools they will control you.  Know what you must do in your job to succeed and \n         \n              create the environment that lets you focus.  If your job calls for 10 second response time on IM, \n         \n              then play along.  If it is a constant distraction, turn it off. \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              <b>Try new things</b> \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              Break \n         \n              your routine occassionally.  Keep a list of random things to do for fun. \n         \n              At least once a week, pick a fun thing and do it.  Life is too serious for most of us. Look up an \n         \n              old friend.  Do a random act of kindness.  Play a practical joke.  Tell someone that you love them. \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              <b>Random item from the past</b> \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              Imagine having a list of things to think about someday.  Now image \n         \n              doing a random selection from that list.  This would give you a miscellaneous topic to ponder for a \n         \n              few minutes.  I use this technique for a number of different lists.  I frequently get emails of \n         \n              ticklers to remind me of things that I originally thought about earlier.  The key idea here is to \n         \n              have a list of topics and a random selection.  You could do the same thing by shuffling 3 x 5 cards \n         \n              with ideas. \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              <b>Say in fewer words</b> \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              I \n         \n              like to make complex subjects simple.  One way to do this is to describe \n         \n              something and then try to capture the same ideas with half of the words.  Is it possible to get the \n         \n              same idea in 5 words?  Try to think in sound bites. \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              <b>List of current problems</b> \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              Consider keeping a list of problems that need think-time.

I have been seeking to turn Shrinking World Solutions into a team of consultants that can\ndeliver high-quality software systems at reasonable cost.\n\nIn the past all of the work billed by the company was for my personal work.  While I intend to work\nin the business full-time and be involved in the daily engineering work, this has real limitations\non the number of engineering hours I can deliver to each client.  The cost is also much higher than\nit should be for the results achieved.\n\nMy goal is to hire, train, deploy, and manage the work of a team of specialists. This will allow us\nto deliver both deeper and broader solutions to our clients.  I plan to be specifying, designing,\nand reviewing the work, while having some others do some of the detailed programming.  \n\nMy son, Josiah, is currently working on a doctorate in bioinformatics at CU.  He wrote an\napplication to view the genome.  I have been collaborating with Josiah and his friend, Bryan Hurst, on\nthis project for about a year.  I am considering hiring Bryan as an associate progammer in my\ncompany.  I met with him today to discuss this and he is open to the idea.\n\nWatermill has need of more programming effort that I can currently afford to provide to finish out\nthe server projects.  There are currently twelve projects underway that are making very slow\nprogress.  This could be a solution help expedite these projects without letting the cost baloon.\n\nCurrently I can provide about 4 hours of engineering and 4 hours of support each week.  This is\nbarely about to keep up with the burden of things that break and unable to expand the current\nsystem. If I were to use 20 hours/week of Bryan's time, I could produce, about 4 hours of support\neach week, and 24 hours of engineering.\n\nI would be responsible for the quality and productivity of all work done for Watermill by Shrinking\nWorld Solutions.  Both training and management would be administered personally by me in\ncollaboration with Bryan.  Initially, he would work out of my office in Windsor, until the need for\ncommunication dimished.\n\nBecause the hourly rate for Bryan would be less than half of what I make, the cost per hour to\nWatermill would be significantly reduced.  I hope that this will be a long term collaboration and\nintend on helping Bryan to develop a career as a leader in software development.  I also hope to use\nthis as a model that would allow other people to be added as needed to my company.\n\nIn order to move forward on this, I need your approval to enlist his help on Watermill projects.  I\nbelieve that I will need to bill out his time at $35/hour in order to create enough incentive to get\nhim involved for the long-term.\n\nIf we are able to move quickly then Bryan can be fully engaged and cover any issues that appear\nwhile I am gone to Jordan.  He has agreed to make this a priority and to commit up to 20 hours\nweekly to this project.\n\nPlease let me know what you think about this proposal.\n\n\nSee also [[Business]]\n", "user": 3, "title": "Watermill Subcontracting"}}, {"pk": 714, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/WritingEditing", "text": "* Writing Editing *                 -*-muse-*-\n*Edit your articles to avoid embarrassment*\n\n\nSee also \n\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Writing Editing"}}, {"pk": 715, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/LearnActions", "text": "* Learn Actions *                 -*-muse-*-\ndiscover\ndecompose\nintegrate\nanalyze\ninvestigate\ncollaborate\nverify\nvalidate\nassert\ncorrect\nhypothesize\norganize\noutline\nexplore\nprototype\nrefine\nplan\nidentify\nunderstand\ngather\nassemble\nbuild on\nreform\nextend\n\nSee also [[Learn]]\n\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Learn Actions"}}, {"pk": 716, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/Generations", "text": "* Generations *                 -*-muse-*-\n\n**Web sites**\n    http://www.lifecourse.com/insight/timelines/generations.html\n    http://www.lifecourse.com/insight/timelines/turnings.html\n\n**Recognize patterns in history**\n    Societies operate on a cycle that is predictable\n    History is a fractal, recurring patterns at different levels of detail\n    The cause for this can be understood\n\n**Cyclical attitudes and events**\n    War cycle\n    Spiritual awakenings\n    Ideas about children\n    Public vs. private interests (security/freedom)\n\n**Generations**\n    Experiences create a similar outlook\n    Each generation spans twenty years (matching the life phases)\n    There are four generational archtypes (or patterns)\n    These patterns occur in a predictable order\n\n**Generational Cycles**\n    Each generation plays a specific role in the cycle\n    Each genation ages together causing  a change of lineup\n    Each lineup produces a unique outlook\n    This create pattern of four distinct seasons every eighty years\n\n**History**\n    History and culture can be viewed as cyclical\n    Social dynamics are tied to the seasons\n    Season changes are abrupt and inevitable\n    Every human experiences every season\n    Winter is more similar to other winters than to spring\n\n**Gerational Patterns** (archtype)\n    Hero -

     -*-muse-*-\n\nWhen you are developing software consider doing the work for a\nspecific context.  In fact there are three unique contexts that are\nimportant at each stage of development.   Understanding what is shared\nand what is unique will speed your development.\n\nThe three contexts that you should consider are:\n 1. **Customer benefit** - when and how will you make business use of the\n    new feature.\n 2. **Product** - how does this feature integrate with the rest of the\n    product features\n 3. **Function** - how does this feature work in total isolation\n\nEvery feature that you write should be developed through all three\ncontexts.  You will plan the three together but you will build and\ntest from the bottom up.\n\n**Functional Context**\nWhen you create a new feature in the software, start by creating the\nsmallest possible context for your development.  This should probably\nresult in creating a two line test that calls a function and tests for\nan expected result.  Actually this is a single line that should look\nsomething like, 'assert(test_is_ok())'.  \n\nThis requires you to completely isolate or encapsulate the\ndependencies of your system.  This act alone will give you a much\nsharper view of your system.  The key part of the functional context\nis to make testing your new code independent of as much of the rest of\nthe system as possible.\n\n**Product Context**\nThe product context is your opportunity to integrate the new feature\nwith all of the other parts of the system.  The functional context\ntests the inside view of the feature, while the product context tests\nthe outside view.\n\nGood testing at this level involves having real world data that you\nput through the entire system to verify the results.  Consider testing\nas a pipeline, 'read input > process > gather output > analyze for errors'.\n\n**Customer Context**\nThe customer context also brings in the issues of how this\nfunctionality gets deployed.  No feature works in isolation. Examine\nthe full customer experience and make sure that the feature integrates\nconsistently with all other aspects of the application.\n\nTesting at this context involves using the product like a real\ncustomer would and may actually involve real customers. Problems\nidentified at this context should be solved and verified at a lower\ncontext level.\n\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Development Contexts"}}, {"pk": 752, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path":

Invitation **\n\n\"If you don't let me love you, you won't finish the race.\"\n\nWe need to learn to simply rest in God.  We need to know his passion for us.  Receiving his love\nbrings refreshment and renewal.\n\nWe need to do the things that Jesus did in order to stay connected.  We can learn to live the way\nthat Jesus lived.\n\nSpiritual disciplines can create a space where we encounter God.\n\nWe never know how in trouble we are until we slow down long enough for God to reveal it to us.\n\nSpiritual disciplines are not the sign of maturity, but rather how we achieve it.\n\nWithout embracing spiritual formation we are doomed to cycles of hitting dead-ends, resulting in\ncynicism.\n\nContemplative prayer is how we create space in our busy lives to be changed by Jesus.\n\nIntimacy (not ministry) must be at the center of our lives.\n\n\n** 2. Spiritual Disciplines **\n\nComing to Jesus is the only answer to weariness.  Matt 11:28\n\nThere are different movements in prayer:  Upward, Outward, Inward\n\nThe upward movement connects us with God's love for himself.  This includes worship, thanksgiving,\npraise, and adoration.\n\nThe outward movement connects us with God's purpose for others.  This includes petitions,\nintercession, and ministry prayer for the sick, oppressed and broken-hearted.\n\nThe inward movement connects us with God in our inner-self (motives, attitudes, and self-concept).\n\nEvangelicals are good with the first two but not the latter.\n\nIn order to really know God, I must begin to know my true self.  This is always painful.\n\nBeneath the roles and masks lies a self that only God fully knows.  It is difficult for us to follow\nGod on the journey of self-discovery.\n\nKnowing God more causes me to admit how broken I really am.  Follow Christ as he takes you into the\ndarkness of your own soul.\n\nInward disciplines create a space where the Spirit can transform us into the nature of Christ.\n\n** 3. Where we encounter ourselves **\n\nPublic self   - What I allow others to see in me.\nPrivate self  - What I hide from others.\nRevealed self - The blind spots that others see.\nUnknown self  - The things that only God knows about.\n\nThe public and private selves must be aligned with the purpose of God in our life.  But true\ntransformation occurs as God touches areas that we have not seen before.\n\nStages of growth: Awakening, Purgation, Illumination, Union\n\nAwakening    - deep awareness of God's presence in our lives\nPurgation    - removing habits, actions, and attitudes that are contrary to God's purpose\nIllumination - experiencing more of God in our joys and sorrows\nUnion        - experiencing God's emotions as we love like he loves\n\n** 4. Our Inward Journey **\n\nCultivate an internal life that sustains outwardly-focus living\n\nSpiritual disciplines provide a context for God to speak and transform our lives.\n\nGrowth is a long-term process that God leads us through\n\nSeasons of life\n * First Love\n * Learning and belonging\n * Serving\n * Surrender to God's love\n * Convergence\n * Integration\n\n** 5. Contemplative Prayer **\n\nAs place of intimacy - When we are together do we always have to discuss work?\n\nGod drives the conversation, He may take us to the abyss of sorrow, dispair, and anger. He may touch\non our place of deepest pain and dysfunction.\n\nProcess your life with God: experiences, frustrations, expectations, fears, confrontations,\nopportunities\n\nPlace of transformation from the inside out.  God's word is living and active and it illuminates our\nmotives.\n\nLearn to rest in God's presence with no specific expectations.\n\nEmbrace discovery\n\n\nSee also PrayerPractices\n", "user": 3, "title": "Prayer As A Place"}}, {"pk": 773, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/TechToys", "text": "* Tech Toys *                 -*-muse-*-\n\n*Use Galaxy tablet to have fun*\n\n**Done**\naccess to Don's fiction books\ninstall eBook converter\n\n**Schedule of tech toys to pursue**\ncreate process to read Don's books\nprocess for using Sugar Sync\nTeam viewer\nMy Music\nWeather\nMy Photos\nEmacs\n\nSee also [[Home]], [[Tools]], [[../MyBook/Android/KeysApplications][KeyApps]]\n\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Tech Toys"}}, {"pk": 774, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/GoogleAnalytics", "text": "* Google Analytics *                 -*-muse-*-\n\n**Steps**\nLogin to http://analytics.google.com\nSetup HTML tag\nDeploy and test\nMonitor traffic to sites\nRegister site on Google\n\n\n**Domains to watch**\nacttolearn.org\ncomsystem.us\nmarkseaman.org\nmybookonline.org\nshrinking-world.org\nseamanslog.com\nexteriorbrain.com\nworld-class-software.com\nfightbitrot.com\nthe-very-idea.us\nspiritual-things.org\n\n**Other domains**\ntheshrinkingworld.com\nseamanfamily.org\ndr-prof.com \nshrinking-world.com\nthe-core-idea.com\nseamansguide.com\nseaman-tech.com\nhow-to-automate.com\nourinwardjourney.com\ncomputercloner.com\nshrinking-world.net\nmarkseaman.info\n\n\n**HTML Tag**\n\nCopy the following code, then paste it onto every page you want to track immediately before the\nclosing </head> tag. \n\n<!-- Google Analytics -->\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-33170601-1']);\n  _gaq.push(['_setDomainName', 'shrinking-world.org']);\n  _gaq.push(['_setAllowLinker', true]);\n  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n  (function() {\n    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

This means that any list where you expect a selection ony works up to \n         \n              nine items.  Longer lists should be broken into multiple selection lists.  A reasonable list should \n         \n              have five or more items to be useful.  Nesting can be used to handle more complicated scenarios. \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              <b>Minimize mindshare</b> \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              Some things we can control and other things we cannot.  Try to make your \n         \n              circle of influence match your circle of concern.  Decrease the amount of mental energy that you \n         \n              invest in areas where you have little influence.  Save your energy for the things that you can \n         \n              change. \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              <b>Eliminate multitasking</b> \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              Your worst enemy is multiple tasks interrupting each other. Focus on one \n         \n              activity as much as possible until it is completed.  Then go on to the next with equal focus.  It \n         \n              is very easy for us to spend as much as 50% of our overall time just switching between multiple \n         \n              tasks.  This has become especially bad in our modern world.

I recommend that you \n         \n              perform this think time in a location where you cannot be interrupted.  Start with one hour per \n         \n              week.  You are likely to find that you need more time, and that it is easily justified by the \n         \n              return that you get. \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              <b>Think before you leap</b> \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              When confronted with a big decision consider taking both paths.

Which is \n         \n              better in the short term or in the long term?  What problem might surface?

This typically involves \n         \n              making a list of various ideas or impression.  During a brainstorm try to postpone judgment.  Once \n         \n              you have captured a bunch of ideas you can work on grouping things together.  This is the time to \n         \n              apply some judgment and pruning. \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              <b>Four by four analysis</b> \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              In order to think through, a topic try this technique. Break your main \n         \n              topic into four roughly equal topics.  Then decompose each of them into four more topics.  I found \n         \n              that this technique is remarkably useful to help me see the interesting aspects of almost any \n         \n              subject. It gives you twenty one statements that have both breadth and depth that can be explored later. \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              <b>Work on only one thing</b> \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              Select a single task that will be the most satisfying to have done. \n         \n              Postpone distractions until this task is complete. By selecting this task you are saying that this \n         \n              is the most important thing that you could do right now.  If you feel that a legitimate \n         \n              interruption is likely then limit the scope of your task to complete it sooner. Then you can focus \n         \n              on another task when needed. \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              <b>Use tools that preserve context</b> \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              Don't have multiple windows up on your computer (each vying for \n         \n              your attention). When you run an application, make the window take the full screen. Finish one \n         \n              thought before going on the next.  Turn off email notification, and check it between tasks.  If you \n         \n              don't control your tools they will control you.  Know what you must do in your job to succeed and \n         \n              create the environment that lets you focus.  If your job calls for 10 second response time on IM, \n         \n              then play along.  If it is a constant distraction, turn it off. \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              <b>Try new things</b> \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              Break \n         \n              your routine occassionally.  Keep a list of random things to do for fun. \n         \n              At least once a week, pick a fun thing and do it.  Life is too serious for most of us. Look up an \n         \n              old friend.  Do a random act of kindness.  Play a practical joke.  Tell someone that you love them. \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              <b>Random item from the past</b> \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              Imagine having a list of things to think about someday.  Now image \n         \n              doing a random selection from that list.  This would give you a miscellaneous topic to ponder for a \n         \n              few minutes.  I use this technique for a number of different lists.  I frequently get emails of \n         \n              ticklers to remind me of things that I originally thought about earlier.  The key idea here is to \n         \n              have a list of topics and a random selection.  You could do the same thing by shuffling 3 x 5 cards \n         \n              with ideas. \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              <b>Say in fewer words</b> \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              I \n         \n              like to make complex subjects simple.  One way to do this is to describe \n         \n              something and then try to capture the same ideas with half of the words.  Is it possible to get the \n         \n              same idea in 5 words?  Try to think in sound bites. \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              <b>List of current problems</b> \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              Consider keeping a list of problems that need think-time.  Pick a \n         \n              problem and analyze it.   Try all your best techniques: pros-and-cons, return on investment, \n         \n              brainstorming, SWOT (strength, weakness, opportunity, threat).  Bang away at the problem for an \n         \n              hour and see if any new solutions pop out. \n         \n              </p><p> \n         \n              </p><p> \n    </div>\n\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n    <hr/>\n        \n    <center>\n      <div id=\"footer\">        \n        <a href='http://shrinking-world.org'>\n          <img src=\"/media/mybook/images/sws_logo_150.png\" />\n          <div>Sponsored by Shrinking World Solutions</div>\n        </a>\n      </div>\n    </center>\n    \n    <b>Seaman's Log</b>\n    <p>You are receiving this message as a subscriber of the Seaman's Log mailing list.

How we spend those hours is important.  We can choose to\nspend those hours making money, or spent money to purchase time.  Either way there is a direct\nexchange between money and time.\n\nA life budget combines the concept of budgeting both money & time spending. If you have a full time\njob then you probably spend at least 2000 a year working. You do this so that you can earn money to\nspend time on the other things that you enjoy.\n\nSpending habits reflect the reasons why you work.  You can replace each dollar amount with the\nequivalent amount of time spent working to pay for it.  For example, if you spend $1000/month on a\nhouse payment and make $50/hour, then your house costs you 20 hours/month.\n\nHere's how it works. \n 1. Create a budget using last years actual spending, limiting yourself to six categories.\n 2. Convert the budget to time, where total dollars equals 2000 hours.\n 3. Create a weekly time budget, showing the six categories.  \n 4. Create an annual time budget for how you spend the 5000 hours each year  \n 5. Combine these to show work hours as percentages that match the money spent\n 6. Group these into large categories (us/them, work/play)\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nSee also [[Time]]\n", "user": 3, "title": "Life

A shell script runs\nby starting up a new program.  When it exits any changes to the environment (like cd) are lost.  A\ncommand like 'l' does not need to change the current environment.

Last week she collapsed and was taken by ambulance\nto the hospital where she received a pace maker. After four days in the hospital she returned home\nwhere she continues to mend. This has increased our overall stress level, but God is working\neverything out.\n\nJosiah is doing really good now.  He has been visiting a chairopracter since November which has had\na remarkable impact on him.  Cassandriel is now five months old and so precious.  Josiah and Sam are\nboth great parents.  So loving and patient.\n\nRachel is doing great.  She plans to return from Japan in August.\n\nChristine recently started working at Xerox in the call center.  She is in her fourth week of\ntraining.\n\nI had some ups and downs with the business but feel good moving forward with it.  I recently have\ntaken on learning about Node.js and related technology to use for the pipe scan project.  I'm\nexploring setting up a new business to do vertical applications for end users.\n\n\n**Week of July 26**\n\nJosiah has been essentially disabled since May 4.  The first week of July he was granted a leave of\nabsence from his doctoral program for up to a year.  Last week he had a battery of tests including\nMRI and EEG.  He said that the EEG captured 20-30 events that can be analyzed.  With a baby girl on\nthe way in October, Josiah and Sam are very stressed over the future.\n\nIn April I decided to end my work with Watermill.  Over the four years I have been working with them\nI have been able to build what they needed.  Now they don't need the full-time work from someone\nlike me.  I am planning on working for Watermill one day each week during August.\n\nI have been working on plans for the next phase of my career.  The most promising path forward is to\ndevelop a short course on software engineering that I can use to help get longer term consulting\nwork. I will present a training session to the software arichtects group in three weeks on Fighting\nBit Rot.  I hope that this will lead to other work opportunities.\n\n**Week of Jan 16**\n\nThis week I saw how volatile life can really be.  I was almost in a head-on accident, which would\nhave been my fault.  I ran a red light, while rushing to get through an intersection on snowy roads.\n\nA day later a teen was killed when a driver crossed the line on 257. \n\nA routine furnace inspedtion revealed that our furnace was inproperly constructed.  We replaced it\nwith a new one and an air conditioner.  This cost us $11K that we were not expecting.\n\nI finally got a budget for our family.  It has a nice simple outline: Tax 30%, Giving Housing Living\nall 20%, Vaction 10%.\n\nMy writing projects are really taking off now.  I am so pleased.  It is very fun to work on these projects.\n\n\n**Week of Nov 27**\n\nThis week was an intense week of work after a lot of time off.  We are trying to release the\nsoftware for the new watermills by the end of the year.  We had two big snow storms which affected\nthe travel to Frederick.  I worked at home on Thursday, and Eric called in paniced on Friday,\nwanting me to come to Frederick to fix bugs that he had just found in testing.  I had told him\nearlier that I would work on Friday, but had not yet started by noon.\n\nI learned enough Emacs lisp to be able to start automating basic commands. This is terribly exciting\nto me.  I have also mapped out a strategy for publishing multiple blogs and books.\n\nI had my second meeting with Tim Musslewhite this week. It was a bit tentative.  But I think we are\nstill working on finding the right way to interact.\n\nI realized that I really don't like the month of December.  I hate having to put up decorations and\nthe conflict that inevitably follows it.  I really dislike the issues with over spending, over\ncommitting, and extra demands that put way too much stress on everyone.  For me the main meaning of\nChristmas is conflict.  It reveals the greatest level of tension between Stacie and I.\n\nWe had our second meeting with the Hoods in Jordan.  God is putting together something very\nspecial.  We feel that we are really connecting with them.\n\nThe Windsor church leaders had a Christmas party at the Nardins' house.  There was a time during the\nparty where each person was able to share about what they really appreciated about someone else.  It\nwas very moving and encouraging.\n\n\n**Week of Nov 20**\n\nThis week was filled with great times to connect with both Eric Stanley and Josiah.  We shared ideas\nand stories about people that they were interacting with, and life experiences.\n\nThis week I launched the Dr Prof Tips newsletter and got my first 20 subscribers.  I got two books on\nblogging which were very helpful.  I also found out about the Octopress platform which is similar to\nMyBook.\n\nRick Olmstead announced this week that we will be focusing on reaching the next generation.  I am\nvery excited about that and am praying about what my role will be.\n\n\nSee also PrayerPractices,  [[Highlights]]\n", "user": 3, "title": "Weekly Highlights"}}, {"pk": 835, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/LightningRound", "text": "* Lightning Round *                 -*-muse-*-\nBest practice for tying up loose ends\n\nSelect 6 tasks to complete in one hour\n\nDo the minimum amount of work to claim success\n\nGet through all tasks\n\nSummarize the follow up actions required\n\nSee also BestPractices\n\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Lightning Round"}}, {"pk": 836, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/WeeklyReview", "text": "* Weekly Review *                 -*-muse-*-\n\nEvaluate the activities of this week to see if they are consistent with my values\n\n**Questions:** \nWhat did I learn?\nHow did I dream?\nWhat did I build?\nWho did I help?\n\n**Review Checklist**\n\n**Past**\nTimeByWeek          assessment of time allocation\nWeeklyHighlights    highs and lows of this week\nMonthlyObjectives   am I on track\n\n**Present**\n[[Highlights]]          most memorable experiences\n\n**Future**\n[[Calendar]]            happening this week\n[[Learn]]               what do I need to learn?\n[[Plan]]                what should I do?\n[[Build]]              problems to solve\n[[Teach]]               sharing with others\n\nSee also PrayerPractices\n\n\n", "user": 3, "title": "Weekly Review"}}, {"pk": 837, "model": "doc.doc", "fields": {"path": "/home/seaman/Documents/Brain/ComputerCloning", "text": "* Computer Cloning *                 -*-muse-*-\n\nIt is possible to quickly setup a new computer by cloning the setup of a previously configured\ncomputer system.  This topic will show you how to accomplish this step-by-step.\n\nReduce the pain of setting up a new computer.  By following this process you can configure a new\ncomputer system in about 2 hours.  This may be just the incentive that you need to try out a Linux\noperating system.  Quick cloning of computer environments is very easy in Linux compared to other\navailable operating systems.\n\nWe all know the pain of setting up a new computer system.  Even though people that work with\ncomputers all of the time have set up many computer systems in the past.\n\nI regularly used about 7 different operating environments.  These differ by location, mobility,\nownership, and purpose.  I now have a recipe that allows a new computer environment to start doing\nuseful work in less than an hour.  Linux lends itself to this type of quick start.\n\nI still find that setting up Windows systems is extremely time intensive.  First, Ubuntu is\ninstalled off of the Live CD.  This operation takes about 20 minutes with about 5 minutes of setup\ntime and a break to watch a half-hour TV show.  When you return you are ready to customize the\nenvironment.\n\nI have special commands that I am constantly updating.  Currently I have about 150 commands that\nautomate everything that I do with the computer.\n\nThese commands are all stored in a directory called bin in my home directory.  They can be moved by\nnetwork or thumb drive to any new system.  Next I link my script to customize the shell from my home\ndirectory using:\n\n  \tln ~/bin/bashrc ~/.bashrc\n\nNow you can make this active.\n\n\t. ~/.bashrc\n\nThis process lets you get up and running in well less than an hour with a computer environment that\nhas all of your favorite automation tools already configured.  Additional configuration can be done\nby including a setup-computer script in your bin directory.\n\nSee also ComputerSetup\n", "user": 3, "title": "Computer Cloning"}}]

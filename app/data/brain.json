Use the best available technologies that are well suited for\n    your specific business problems.\n\n    Use tools that are readily available to solve common problems. Build new tools only\n    when required to solve your unique problem.  A standard tool can often solve a problem\n    with a small fraction of the investment required by custom software.\n\n    Pick tools that are proven to produce better results. We have over 50 years of\n    combined engineering experience that makes us experts at tool selection. \n\n    Key Technologies Used:\n    * Linux\n    * Python\n    * Django\n    * Node JS\n    * Angular JS\n    * Git\n    \n\n**Better Process**\n\n    How you build software dictates the results that you will get.  The software process\n    dictates how you plan, design, implement, test, deploy, and maintain your software.\n\n    Design patterns increase leverage. Use standard solutions to common problem.  Figure\n    out the changing elements and develop standard solutions that can be applied to future\n    problems. \n\n    Create common coding patterns to leverage code resue.  Software can be reused in many\n    ways and all levels.  Define your product development strategy to maximize leverage of\n    the definition, design, libraries, and functions that you develop.\n\n    We use the following processes because they have proven to produce better results.\n    Best practices result in higher quality and lower cost.\n\n    * Frameworks increase leverage\n    * Common problems are already solved\n    * Extensive use of code generation\n    * Completely automatic testing\n    * Flexibility of custom code at the cost of off-the-shelf code\n\n\n**Better Project Management**\n\n    We deliver results weekly! This lets you see the resulting product long before it is\n    done. You define the project scope and priorities.\n\n    Redirect the engineering to match growing understanding of need.  We believe that it\n    is impossible to understand the full product at the beginning of the project.  By\n    building the product you can se and respond to the design throughout the development.\n\n    Traditional software planning defines the product details at the beginning of the\n    project.  Then the development proceeds until the most of the budget is consumed.\n    This is far too late to make meaningful changes.  We beleive that this is a serious\n    mistake that leads to failed projects.\n\n    We will send results to you so that you can see the product as it emerges. This gives\n    you the opportunity to redirect the work to match your priorities.  Do as much (or as\n    little) as you want. This flexible work engagement helps you get exactly what you want.\n\n\n**Full range of services**\n\nWe manage, create, test, and support software development.  Use us as you would your own\nengineering teams.\n\nManage\n\n    understand top business needs\n    prioritize work\n    communicate progress\n    coordinate\n\nCreate\n\n    deliver solutions to top problems\n    develop new tools for future problems\n    leverage systems for efficiency\n    rapid development and incremental deployment\n\nTest\n\n    find defects immediately\n    build automatic tests\n    leverage tools across projects\n    focus coverage on top priorities\n\nSupport\n\n    refactoring of legacy code\n    keep the system running\n    address new bix needs quickly\n    understand operations\n    embrace biz needs\n    training in best practices\n \n\n**Simple Pricing**\n\nChoosing the correct pricing model for your project.

Each\nof the unique technologies work together to bring a stable foundation\nfor the MyBook platform. Any of these technologies may be replaced by\nanother that provides improved characteristics. This chapter outline\nthe current technology stack that is used today.\n\n**Technologies**\n * Linux\n * Apache/MySQL\n * Python/Django\n * CSS/HTML\n\n**Django** \nThe most important technology decision for MyBook is the\nselection of the Django web application framework. Django is perfect\nfor these types of applications. It is easy to write shell scripts\nthat write the custom code for the application.\n\nDjango is very flexible in allowing custom code where it is needed\nwhile eliminating any repeated code structures that are common within\nweb applications. In other words it is easy to write a simple program\nthat does nothing and then grow it into a powerful application by\nincrementally adding features.\n\n**Python**\nThe Django application framework is written mostly in the\nPython programming language. Python is a very concise and powerful\nlanguage. Programmers familiar with Python are much more productive\nthan programmers using other languages. There is excellent support for\nboth high and low-level language features.\n\nPython also enjoys some of the fastest execution times for scripting\nlanguages. It is extremely portable and can run across many computer\narchitectures and operating systems.\n\n**MySQL**\nThe MyBook application saves its data in a MySQL\ndatabase. MySQL is an open-sourced implementation of the Structured\nQuery Language (SQL) that drives most databases in use today. It is\navailable free of charge. It is free to use in any way that you see\nfit.\n\nOverall it is the leading choice of developers looking for an\nalternative to the proprietary solutions provided by large\nvendors.

**Choosing your price model**

Choosing the correct pricing model for your project. How you want to pay for your project
depends on a number of different factors.


Effort-based pricing

 * Pay for each hour of engineering services delivered.
 * Works best if many details of the project are unknown.
 * Good fit for exploratory work.
 * Project can be guided throughout the development.
 * Maximizes flexibility.

Value-based price model:

 * Pay for the value delivered.
 * Works best if the project is well understood.
 * Good for routine work like replacing existing functionality.
 * Requires clear understanding of project scope.
 * More expensive for exploratory projects.
 * Requires concrete and robust project specifications.

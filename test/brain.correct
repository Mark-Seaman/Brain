depends on a number of different factors.

 * Works best if many details of the project are unknown.
 * Good fit for exploratory work.
 * Project can be guided throughout the development.
 * Maximizes flexibility.

Value-based price model:

 * Pay for the value delivered.
 * Works best if the project is well understood.
 * Good for routine work like replacing existing functionality.
 * Requires clear understanding of project scope.
 * More expensive for exploratory projects.
 * Requires concrete and robust project specifications.
